"""Per-session event sequencing + bounded replay for WS reconnects.

Every gateway event frame that flows through :func:`server.write_json` (and
therefore ``_emit``) is stamped with a per-session monotonic ``seq`` and
appended to a small ring buffer keyed by session id. A reconnecting client
calls the ``session.events.since`` RPC with its last observed seq; the server
replays everything newer from the buffer, then live events resume seamlessly.

Design constraints honored:
- stdio TUI path unaffected: frames gain a ``seq`` field only on event frames;
  Ink ignores unknown params keys.
- Thread safety: a single module lock guards counters + buffers; write_json
  already serializes per-transport writes, so stamping under the lock cannot
  reorder frames relative to each other.
- Memory bound: _REPLAY_BUFFER_MAX events / _REPLAY_SESSIONS_MAX sessions,
  oldest session evicted FIFO.
