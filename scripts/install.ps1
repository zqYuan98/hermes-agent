    #   * Hermes-Setup.exe (the signed Tauri bootstrap installer) passes
    #     -IncludeDesktop so a user who installed via the GUI ends up
    #     with a launchable desktop binary.
    #   * The Electron desktop's own bootstrap-runner.ts runs install.ps1
    #     from inside an already-launched Hermes.exe; if THAT recursively
    #     built apps/desktop it would try to overwrite the live Hermes.exe
    #     on disk and fail. The recursive path omits the flag.
    #   * The canonical CLI one-liner (irm | iex) omits the flag too;
    #     terminal users don't need a desktop binary built for them, and

# 8.3 short-path normalization
# ============================================================================
# Windows generates an 8.3 short alias for a user-profile folder whose name
# contains a space ("First Last" -> FIRST~1.LAS), a dot ("Stone.ZEN8" ->
# STONE~1.ZEN), or an accented character ("Ruben" spelled with an acute e ->
# RUBN~1). It can then expose %TEMP%, %TMP%, %LOCALAPPDATA%, %APPDATA% and
# %USERPROFILE% -- plus everything derived from them, including the default
# HERMES_HOME and InstallDir -- in that short form:
#   C:\Users\FIRST~1.LAS\AppData\Local\Temp
#
# PowerShell's FileSystem provider mishandles the aliased component when such a
# path reaches a provider cmdlet (`Tee-Object -FilePath`, `Out-File`,
# `New-Item`, `Test-Path`), throwing "An object at the specified path
# C:\Users\FIRST~1.LAS does not exist" -- localized on non-English hosts.
# Every Node/Electron stage streams its build log to %TEMP% via Tee-Object and
# the desktop stage probes the binary it produced under the profile-derived
# InstallDir, so the bootstrap aborts even though the artifact built fine.
# The Python/uv stages, which never hand a %TEMP% path to a provider cmdlet,
# sail through -- which is why the failure looks Node-specific.
#
# Expanding every profile-rooted path back to long form once, up front, lets
# every downstream cmdlet and child process see something the provider can
# resolve. Three resolvers, tried in order, because no single one covers every
# host:
#
#   1. kernel32!GetLongPathNameW -- expands any 8.3 component regardless of
#      locale, including the accented-username aliases the COM resolver misses.
#   2. Scripting.FileSystemObject -- fallback for hosts where P/Invoke is
#      blocked.
#   3. Profile-root substitution -- when the volume has 8.3 generation disabled
#      or the alias is stale, neither resolver can expand the name because it
#      no longer maps to anything on disk. The aliased component is always the
#      profile folder itself (everything below it was created long), so swap in
#      a profile root we can prove is long and reattach the tail.
#
# All three degrade to returning the input untouched, so a host where none of
# them apply -- including non-Windows -- behaves exactly as it did before.

# `engine-strict=true`, making that mismatch fatal at the first `npm ci`.
# Provision the right npm here instead of reacting to EBADENGINE later.
#
# Three details are load-bearing, mirroring _nb_ensure_bundled_npm_range in
# scripts/lib/node-bootstrap.sh and upgrade_managed_npm in
# hermes_cli/npm_engine.py:
#   - a temp cwd, so the checkout's own .npmrc (engine-strict,
#     min-release-age) does not gate the very upgrade meant to satisfy it;
#   - npm_config_min_release_age=0, which also neutralises a user ~/.npmrc;
#   - an explicit --prefix at the managed tree, so the upgrade rewrites the
#     tree's own npm rather than installing a second copy elsewhere.
#
# Best-effort: a failure leaves a working Node with an old npm, which beats no

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Ensure Git (and Git Bash) are installed.  Git for Windows bundles bash.exe
    which Hermes uses to run shell commands.

    Priority order (deliberately simple -- no winget, no registry, no system
    package manager):
      1. Existing ``git`` on PATH -- use it as-is (the common fast path).
      2. Download **PortableGit** from the official git-for-windows GitHub
         release (self-extracting 7z.exe) and unpack it to
         ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\git`` -- never touches system Git, never
         requires admin, works even on locked-down machines and machines
         with a broken system Git install.

    **Why PortableGit, not MinGit:**  MinGit is the minimal-automation
    distribution and ships ONLY ``git.exe`` -- no bash, no POSIX utilities.
    Hermes needs ``bash.exe`` to run shell commands.  PortableGit is the
    full Git for Windows distribution without the installer UI; it ships
    ``git.exe`` + ``bash.exe`` + ``sh``, ``awk``, ``sed``, ``grep``, ``curl``,
    ``ssh``, etc. in ``usr\bin\``.

    We deliberately skip winget because it fails badly when the system Git
    install is in a half-installed state (partially registered, or uninstall-
    blocked).  Owning the Hermes copy of Git ourselves is predictable and
    recoverable: if it ever breaks, ``Remove-Item %LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\git``
    and re-running this installer fully recovers.

    After install we locate ``bash.exe`` and persist the path in
    ``HERMES_GIT_BASH_PATH`` (User scope) so Hermes can find it in a fresh
    shell without a second PATH refresh.

# ============================================================================
# Stage protocol
# ============================================================================
#
# install.ps1 supports a small, stable "stage protocol" that lets programmatic
# callers (the desktop GUI's onboarding wizard, CI, future install.sh, etc.)
# drive the install one step at a time and surface progress/errors with their
# own UI.  CLI users running the canonical `irm | iex` one-liner never
# encounter this -- default invocation behaves exactly as before.
#
# Entry points:
#
#   install.ps1                       Interactive install (today's behavior).
#   install.ps1 -ProtocolVersion      Emit the protocol version integer.
#   install.ps1 -Manifest             Emit the stage manifest as JSON.
#   install.ps1 -Stage <name>         Run one stage and emit its result.
#   install.ps1 -NonInteractive       Disable all Read-Host prompts (also
#                                     skips the setup wizard and the gateway
#                                     autostart prompt).  Can be combined
#                                     with default invocation to do a full
#                                     non-interactive install.
#   install.ps1 -Json                 Emit machine-readable JSON instead of
#                                     the human-readable success banner at
#                                     the end of a full install.
#
# Manifest schema (the JSON returned by -Manifest):
#
#   {
#     "protocol_version": 1,
#     "stages": [
#       {
#         "name": "uv",
#         "title": "Installing uv package manager",
#         "category": "prereqs",
#         "needs_user_input": false
#       },
#       ...
#     ]
#   }
#
# Stage result (the JSON written by -Stage <name>):
#
#   {
#     "stage": "uv",
#     "ok": true,
#     "skipped": false,
#     "reason": null,
#     "duration_ms": 1234
#   }
#
# Exit codes:
#
#   0 -- success (stage ran, or stage was deliberately skipped).
#   1 -- generic failure; the stage threw.
#   2 -- unknown stage name passed to -Stage.
#
# Adding a stage:
#
#   1. Append an entry to $InstallStages below.
#   2. Make sure the worker function it points at is idempotent and respects
#      $NonInteractive when it has prompts.  Add it before "configure"
#      (the wizard) or "gateway" (autostart) if it should run unconditionally;
#      after those if it's optional post-install glue.
#   3. Do NOT bump $InstallStageProtocolVersion -- adding stages is additive.
#      Drivers iterate the manifest dynamically.
#
# ============================================================================

# stage name (the API contract drivers depend on) to the worker function that
