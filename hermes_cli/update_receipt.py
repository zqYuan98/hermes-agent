"""Structured update receipts + post-update fleet version verification.

Phase 1 of the fleet-update reliability plan (#91277): the updater must
*prove* its outcome instead of assuming it.

Two additive capabilities, both designed so a failure inside them can never
break an update (every public entry point is exception-swallowing):

1. **Update receipt** — a machine-readable JSON record of what one
   ``hermes update`` run discovered, did, skipped (and why), written to
   ``<HERMES_HOME>/logs/update_receipts/``. Silent-failure classes this
   makes visible: #88848 (helper died after "success" printed), #74973
   (restart silently skipped), #85753 (restart phase never ran), #81193
   (desktop shows failure for a successful update).

2. **Fleet version verification** — after the restart phase, read every
   profile's ``gateway_state.json``, compare each live gateway's stamped
   ``code_sha`` (written by ``gateway/status.py`` on every runtime-status
   write) against the freshly-updated checkout's HEAD, and print a fleet
   version matrix. Mixed-version fleets (#88654, #69754, #77553, #56717)
   become a loud, actionable report instead of a latent state.

Deployment-kind awareness (docker/image-managed installs) rides on
``hermes_cli.build_info.get_code_identity()``: an image build reports
``source="build-file"`` and the receipt records that the install is not
in-place updatable.
