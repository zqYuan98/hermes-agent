"""Safe ``tar.gz`` primitives shared by the profile and kanban transfer paths.

Both ``hermes profile export|import`` and ``hermes kanban export|import``
ship a directory to another machine and unpack whatever comes back. The
unpack side is the dangerous half: a hand-crafted archive can carry
``../`` members, absolute paths, symlinks, or device nodes, any of which
turn an import into an arbitrary-write primitive. These helpers are the
one place that logic lives so a second transfer surface can't ship a
second, subtly weaker extractor.

The writer is deliberately not :func:`shutil.make_archive`: that emits
PAX (Python's tarfile default since 3.8), whose fractional-mtime records
macOS Archive Utility rejects — double-clicking an exported profile threw
"Error 94 - Bad message." GNU format keeps long paths working (longlink
extensions) and stays integer-mtime, so Finder, bsdtar, and gnutar all
extract it.
