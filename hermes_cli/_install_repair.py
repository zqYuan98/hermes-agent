"""Dependency install execution shared between early recovery and full recovery.

Both callers need to run the same core ``.[all]`` reinstall:

- ``hermes_cli._early_recovery.recover_if_needed`` — stdlib-only, runs BEFORE
  ``hermes_cli.main``'s third-party imports, so it can complete a pending
  update while no native extension is mapped yet (#83569).
- ``hermes_cli.main._recover_core_update_marker_locked`` — the historical
  post-import recovery path. Kept as a fallback for installs the early pass
  could not complete (marker left in place on failure).

This module is deliberately **stdlib-only** so importing it can never fail in
the corrupted-venv state it exists to repair. ``hermes_cli.main`` imports
``managed_uv``, ``hermes_constants``, and friends only in its late path; the
early path must not. Where the late path uses ``managed_uv.ensure_uv`` to
bootstrap uv if missing, the early path uses the stdlib
:func:`hermes_cli._early_recovery._find_uv_binary` lookup and falls back to
plain pip when uv is absent — a degraded but working installer (the late
recovery will bootstrap uv on the next launch if it ever matters).

    On Windows, ``hermes`` resolves through launchers derived from the venv
    console scripts — never ``venv\\Scripts`` itself on PATH, which would
    shadow the user's ``python`` (#83797). The canonical launcher home is
    the managed binary dir — the default Hermes root's ``bin``
    (``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\hermes\\bin``, next to the managed uv) — which lives
    OUTSIDE the git checkout so no git operation can ever touch it. It is
    a per-machine dir shared by every profile: ``get_hermes_home()`` would
    point inside ``profiles\\<name>`` under ``hermes -p``, so the anchor
    here is :func:`hermes_constants.get_default_hermes_root`.

    Earlier installer versions staged them at ``<checkout>\\bin`` instead —
    inside the git working tree — where ``hermes update``'s pre-update
    autostash (``git stash push --include-untracked``) swept them off disk;
    once the desktop updater stopped re-applying stashes (``--keep-stash``)
    nothing restored them and ``hermes`` stopped resolving in every new
    terminal. That legacy location is re-staged too, during the transition,
    for installs whose user PATH still resolves through it.

    The launcher FORM depends on the venv (see :func:`_venv_is_relocatable`):
    a normal venv's exe trampoline embeds an absolute interpreter path and
    survives copying, so it is copied as ``<name>.exe``; a relocatable
    venv's trampoline resolves relative to its own location and a copy
    dies with ``uv trampoline failed to canonicalize script path``, so a
    ``<name>.cmd`` delegator invoking the in-venv exe by absolute path is
    written instead. A name counts as present when EITHER form exists —
    exe copies staged before a venv rebuild keep working (they embed the
    swapped-in-place venv's absolute path) and are left alone.

    Two targets, two gates, both failing toward inaction:

    - canonical managed binary dir: only when *root* is the managed clone
      (``root.parent == get_default_hermes_root()``), so source checkouts
      elsewhere never gain launchers;
    - legacy ``<root>\\bin``: only when that dir is on the user PATH
      (registry value, process PATH as fallback), i.e. the install opted
      into the old layout and still resolves through it.

    Writes go through a staging name + ``os.replace`` so concurrent process
    starts cannot tear a launcher. Never raises; returns the restored paths.

    *windows* and *user_path_entries* are injectable for tests, same pattern
    as ``hermes_constants.venv_bin_dir``.
