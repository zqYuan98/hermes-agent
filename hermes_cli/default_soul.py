# maintainer-directed rewrite) -- this is the text virtually every real user
# actually gets, since _ensure_default_soul_md() seeds it into SOUL.md on
# first run. DEFAULT_AGENT_IDENTITY only serves sessions with no SOUL.md at

# "targeted and efficient exploration" line is deliberately absent -- see the
# comment on DEFAULT_AGENT_IDENTITY for why -- never re-add it here either.
