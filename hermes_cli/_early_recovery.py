"""Dependency-light venv recovery that runs BEFORE hermes_cli.main's imports.

The ``hermes`` console entry point is ``hermes_cli.main:main``.  Importing
``hermes_cli.main`` pulls in third-party packages at module level (``dotenv``
via ``hermes_cli.env_loader``, ``yaml`` via ``hermes_cli.config``, ...).  In
the exact failure state the update-recovery markers exist for — a failed lazy
backend refresh or interrupted core install that wiped a core package's
import files (#57828) — a normal launch crashes *while importing main.py*,
before ``_recover_from_interrupted_install()`` can run.  The marker system is
unreachable precisely when it is needed most.

This module is deliberately **stdlib-only** so importing it can never fail on
a corrupted venv.  ``hermes_cli.main`` imports and calls
:func:`recover_if_needed` at the very top of its module body, before any
third-party import.

Scope: this early pass only repairs enough for ``hermes_cli.main`` to become
importable again (force-reinstall of the known-fragile core packages, using
the pins from pyproject.toml).  It NEVER clears the recovery markers — the
full, confirmed marker lifecycle stays with ``_recover_from_interrupted_install()``
in main.py, which runs right after import succeeds.

    attempts ceiling caps automatic retries so a persistent installer
    failure does not block every launch (``hermes acp`` included).
