"""On-demand worktree + branch reclaim (``hermes worktree`` / ``/worktree prune``).

The startup pruner in ``cli._prune_stale_worktrees`` is deliberately
conservative and silent: it runs before the banner on every ``hermes -w``
launch, so it only reaps clean, fully-merged scratch trees past an age tier
and preserves everything else. That policy is correct for an unattended
startup path — but it means real installs accumulate two kinds of debris the
startup pass can never touch:

- **Preserved trees** whose only "dirt" is untracked scratch (PR body drafts,
  logs) on an otherwise merged branch — preserved forever by the dirty guard.
- **Orphaned local branches** beyond the two auto-generated prefixes the
  startup pass deletes (``hermes/hermes-*``, ``pr-*``): salvage lanes, port
  branches, feature branches whose PRs merged months ago. Multi-agent boxes
  reach hundreds.

This module is the *attended* counterpart: an explicit, loud, dry-run-first
reclaim the user invokes, so it can be more thorough while staying just as
safe. Invariants shared with the startup pruner (never violated here either):

- tracked modifications are NEVER deleted, at any age, in any mode;
- unique unpushed commits are NEVER deleted (``git cherry`` patch-equivalence
  decides "unique"; shallow repos are deepened bloblessly first so the
  verdict is trustworthy);
- live-locked trees (owning pid alive) are never touched;
- a branch is deleted only after its worktree removal succeeded — a failed
  removal must not orphan reachable commits;
- untracked-only dirt is ARCHIVED to ``~/.hermes/archive/worktree-prune/``
  before its tree is reaped, never destroyed.

Classification primitives are imported from ``cli`` so the two paths can
never drift apart on what "dirty", "unpushed", or "merged" means.
