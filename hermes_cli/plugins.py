"""
Hermes Plugin System
====================

Discovers, loads, and manages plugins from four sources:

1. **Bundled plugins** – ``<repo>/plugins/<name>/`` (shipped with hermes-agent;
   ``memory/`` and ``context_engine/`` subdirs are excluded — they have their
   own discovery paths)
2. **User plugins**   – ``~/.hermes/plugins/<name>/``
3. **Project plugins** – ``./.hermes/plugins/<name>/`` (opt-in via
   ``HERMES_ENABLE_PROJECT_PLUGINS``)
4. **Pip plugins**     – packages that expose the ``hermes_agent.plugins``
   entry-point group.

Later sources override earlier ones on name collision, so a user or project
plugin with the same name as a bundled plugin replaces it.

Each directory plugin must contain a ``plugin.yaml`` manifest **and** an
``__init__.py`` with a ``register(ctx)`` function.

Lifecycle hooks
---------------
Plugins may register callbacks for any of the hooks in ``VALID_HOOKS``.
The agent core calls ``invoke_hook(name, **kwargs)`` at the appropriate
points.

Tool registration
-----------------
``PluginContext.register_tool()`` delegates to ``tools.registry.register()``
so plugin-defined tools appear alongside the built-in tools.

        The ``kind`` semantics are the same for pip entry points as for
        directory plugins: memory providers (``exclusive``) and model
        providers (``model-provider``) have their own discovery systems,
        so importing them here registers nothing and only pays the
        module's import cost in every Hermes process (e.g. a pip
        memory-provider plugin pulling in onnxruntime via fastembed —
        ~60 MB RSS on startup).

        The module source is read without importing the module or any
        of its parent packages (see ``_resolve_module_source``); only
        the first 8192 chars are scanned, mirroring the directory-plugin
        heuristic. Unresolvable or non-Python modules stay ``standalone``.

        Activation contract: this method only decides whether the general
        manager imports the module — it does not activate anything.
        Memory and model providers activate through their own systems
        (``memory.provider`` config via ``plugins/memory`` directory
        discovery; ``providers/`` lazy directory discovery). Both are
        directory-based today, so a pip-only provider is recorded for
        introspection but not activatable until those systems gain
        entry-point discovery (tracked for memory: #40644). That is not
        a regression: pre-change such a provider was equally
        unactivatable — it was merely imported first, at full cost
        (e.g. fastembed -> onnxruntime), and logged
        ``no register() function``. Classification removes the cost
        without changing the activation surface, and is the prerequisite
        that prevents double-import once entry-point activation lands.

        A platform plugin can ship two independent things: an inbound adapter
        (heavy — it imports the platform SDK) and outbound client tools the
        agent calls like any other tool. Deferring the plugin defers both, so
        in a CLI/TUI process the client tools never register at all:
        ``resolve_toolset()`` returns ``[]``, the toolset is missing from the
        ``hermes tools`` checklist, and even an explicit ``platform_toolsets``
        entry is dropped because the key is unknown. The same tools work in
        gateway/web processes only because those materialize every platform at
        startup (issue #78050).

        Client tools that live in a dedicated ``tools`` submodule can be

        Opting in is explicit: the manifest must declare ``provides_tools``

        plugin's tools, per #78538). Keying off the mere presence of a

        put internal helpers there — and would leave the contract invisible to
        anyone reading the manifest. ``tools.py`` remains where the code is

        Hook payloads evolve additively. Callbacks that accept ``**kwargs``
        receive the complete payload; older callbacks with a narrow signature
        receive only the keyword arguments they declare. Each callback is
        wrapped in its own try/except so a misbehaving plugin cannot break the
        core agent loop.

        Hot-path / observer hooks in ``_HOOK_TIMEOUT_BOUNDED_HOOKS`` and the
        policy hook ``pre_tool_call`` are bounded by
        ``plugins.hook_callback_timeout`` (default 30s). On timeout the worker
        is abandoned (not joined) so we do not reintroduce the #6622 hang.
        Timed-out or still-running ``pre_tool_call`` callbacks fail closed
        with a block directive; other bounded hooks fail open (skip).

        ``subagent_stop`` (and any hook in ``_HOOK_CALLER_THREAD_HOOKS``)
        always runs on the caller thread to preserve the documented parent-
        thread serialization contract.

        Returns a list of non-``None`` return values from callbacks.

        For ``pre_llm_call``, callbacks may return a dict describing
        context to inject into the current turn's user message::

            {"context": "recalled text..."}
            "recalled text..."          # plain string, equivalent

        Context is ALWAYS injected into the user message, never the
        system prompt.  This preserves the prompt cache prefix — the
        system prompt stays identical across turns so cached tokens
        are reused.  All injected context is ephemeral — never
        persisted to session DB.
