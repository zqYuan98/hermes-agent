"""Cookie helpers for dashboard auth.

Three cookies in play:
  - hermes_session_at:   the OAuth access token
                         (HttpOnly, lifetime = token TTL, ~15 min)
  - hermes_session_rt:   the OAuth refresh token
                         (HttpOnly, lifetime = 24h, ROTATING + reuse-detected)
                         Nous Portal issues a rotating refresh token for the
                         dashboard auth-code grant (Portal NAS #293 / hermes
                         #37247). ``set_session_cookies`` writes this cookie
                         whenever the provider returns a non-empty
                         ``refresh_token``; the middleware uses it to rotate a
                         fresh access token transparently on AT expiry. A
                         provider that omits the refresh token (empty string)
                         degrades gracefully to access-token-only sessions —
                         the RT cookie is simply not written.
  - hermes_session_pkce: short-lived PKCE state + CSRF nonce + provider
                         hint (HttpOnly, lifetime = 10 minutes)

The two session cookies are ``SameSite=Lax`` and live under the prefix's
Path. The PKCE cookie is the exception: ``SameSite=None`` over HTTPS,
falling back to ``Lax`` on plain HTTP (where ``SameSite=None`` is invalid
without ``Secure``). It is set on the ``/auth/login`` 302 and must survive
the cross-site redirect chain out to the IDP and back to
``/auth/callback``; Chromium intermittently drops ``Lax`` cookies set on a
302 in such a chain (crbug 40508226), which surfaces as "Missing PKCE
state cookie". ``Secure`` is set ONLY when the dashboard was reached over
HTTPS — detected via the request URL scheme, which honours
``X-Forwarded-Proto`` upstream of Fly's TLS terminator when uvicorn is
configured with ``proxy_headers=True``. Loopback dev traffic is always
HTTP so ``Secure`` would lock the cookies out of the browser.

NOTE: uvicorn only honours ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` from a peer inside its
``forwarded_allow_ips`` (default: ``127.0.0.1``). A TLS terminator that
reaches the dashboard from a non-loopback address — e.g. a reverse proxy
in its own container — is not trusted, so the request still looks like
HTTP here and these cookies are written in their HTTP shape.

Cookie prefix selection (browser hardening per
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-west-cookie-prefixes):

  * Loopback HTTP — bare name. ``__Host-`` / ``__Secure-`` require
    ``Secure``, which is incompatible with HTTP.
  * Gated HTTPS, direct deploy (Path=/) — ``__Host-`` prefix. Binds the
    cookie to the exact origin (no Domain attribute) — strongest spec
    guarantee.
  * Gated HTTPS, behind a reverse-proxy prefix (Path=/hermes) —
    ``__Secure-`` prefix. ``__Host-`` is disallowed when Path != "/";
    ``__Secure-`` keeps the Secure-required hardening without the
    Path constraint, and the explicit ``Path=/hermes`` covers
    same-origin app isolation.

The setters and readers BOTH consult the active prefix because the
cookie *name* changes — a reader that looked up the bare name when the
setter wrote ``__Secure-hermes_session_at`` would never find the value.

Refresh-token handling:
   ``set_session_cookies`` accepts ``refresh_token=""`` (provider omitted
   it) and silently skips writing the RT cookie in that case, so a
   refresh-token-less provider degrades to access-token-only sessions.
   ``clear_session_cookies`` always emits a Max-Age=0 deletion for the RT
   cookie on logout / session expiry so a stale cookie from an earlier
   deployment gets cleared. The transparent rotation flow ("expired AT +
   live RT → rotate server-side, else 401 → /login") lives in
   ``middleware._attempt_refresh``.

       base64 that decodes to a JSON object. Legacy forms can never
       match — they always contain ``%`` (URL-encoded, #99176) or a raw
       ``;`` (oldest flat form), both outside the base64url alphabet.
    2. **Oldest flat form** (pre-#99176): raw ``;`` between segments
       (``provider=…;state=…;verifier=…``). Split as-is WITHOUT
       unquoting the payload — the ``next`` segment carries its own
       single URL-encoding, and unquoting here would turn a ``%3B``
       inside it into a bogus delimiter and truncate the post-login
       target. Neither newer format can contain a raw ``;``.
    3. **URL-encoded flat form** (#99176): the whole flat payload passed
       through ``quote(payload, safe="")`` — no raw ``;`` possible
       (it is ``%3B``); unquote once, then split.

    Rollout directions: OLD cookie → NEW server is handled here (rungs
    2 and 3 parse both legacy forms correctly). NEW cookie → OLD server
    (a rollback, or a mixed fleet routing the callback to a not-yet-
    upgraded instance) fails the OAuth state check — the old reader
    can't find a ``state`` segment in the base64url blob — and the user
