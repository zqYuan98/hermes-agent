"""
SQLite State Store for Hermes Agent.

Provides persistent session storage with FTS5 full-text search, replacing
the per-session JSONL file approach. Stores session metadata, full message
history, and model configuration for CLI and gateway sessions.

Key design decisions:
- WAL mode for concurrent readers + one writer (gateway multi-platform)
- FTS5 virtual table for fast text search across all session messages
- Compression-triggered session splitting via parent_session_id chains
- Batch runner and RL trajectories are NOT stored here (separate systems)
- Session source tagging ('cli', 'telegram', 'discord', etc.) for filtering

# SQLite's WAL mode requires shared-memory (mmap) coordination and fcntl
# byte-range locks that don't reliably work on network filesystems (NFS,
# SMB/CIFS, some FUSE mounts, WSL1).  Upstream documents this explicitly:
# https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html#sometimes_queries_return_sqlite_busy_in_wal_mode
#
# On those filesystems ``PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`` raises
# ``sqlite3.OperationalError: locking protocol`` (SQLITE_PROTOCOL).  If we
# propagate that, every feature backed by state.db / kanban.db breaks
# silently — /resume, /title, /history, /branch, kanban dispatcher, etc.
#
# ZFS is a separate case: its COW + mmap semantics can corrupt the WAL
# shared-memory (-shm) file under concurrent connection bursts, presenting
# as ``disk I/O error`` rather than ``locking protocol``.
#
# Instead, fall back to ``journal_mode=DELETE`` (the pre-WAL default) which
# works on NFS and ZFS.  Concurrency drops — concurrent readers are blocked
# during a write — but the feature works.
#
# Separately, SQLite's WAL-reset bug can corrupt multi-process WAL databases

# refuse to *enable* WAL for fresh / non-WAL databases (prefer DELETE).  We do

    transaction ever run against it.

    A single bulk operation is enough to strand gigabytes. Observed on a
    3.0 GB ``state.db``: ``hermes sessions optimize`` (FTS merge + VACUUM)
    rewrites every page through the WAL, leaving a **3.07 GB**
    ``state.db-wal`` sitting next to the database indefinitely — the host

    That also makes the maintenance command self-defeating on exactly the

    assumes the OS honors the fsync write barrier; macOS does not unless

    On WAL-incompatible filesystems (NFS, SMB, some FUSE, ZFS), SQLite either
    raises ``OperationalError("locking protocol")`` /
    ``OperationalError("disk I/O error")`` or — on macOS NFS / SMB /
    the AgentFS NFS overlay — silently refuses the switch and leaves the DB in
    DELETE.  Either way the degradation is logged at ERROR level (it is a real
    loss of concurrency — a write blocks concurrent readers — not a cosmetic
    warning) and, by default, the function falls back to DELETE (the pre-WAL
    default, which works on NFS and ZFS) so the feature keeps working.

    On SQLite builds that still contain the WAL-reset corruption bug
    (issue #69784), refuse to enable WAL on fresh / non-WAL databases
    (prefer DELETE).  If the on-disk DB is already WAL, keep WAL and warn
    — never live-downgrade under possible concurrent openers.

    This gate (#70055) is deliberately RETAINED. An earlier revision of the
    lock-cancellation fix (#71724) reverted it on the theory that DELETE was
    "the mode that corrupts", but that comparison was confounded: the clean
    WAL result came from SQLite 3.53.1, which carries BOTH the WAL-reset fix
    AND 3.51.0's defenses against close()-broken POSIX locks, so it says
    nothing about 3.50.4.  Re-measured on the actually-bundled 3.50.4 with
    the lock fix in place, WAL and DELETE are both clean (0/3 each) — i.e.
    there is no evidence that WAL is safer here, and upstream still documents
    the WAL-reset bug as real through 3.51.2 with serious consequences.  Until
    a fixed runtime is delivered, keep new databases out of WAL.

    Callers that genuinely require WAL concurrency (and would rather fail loudly
    than run silently degraded) pass ``require_wal=True``; the function then
    raises :class:`WalUnsupportedError` instead of returning ``"delete"``.  All
    current callers deliberately keep the default ``require_wal=False`` so
    NFS-homed installs keep working.

    The ERROR is deduplicated per ``db_label``: repeated connections to the
    same underlying DB (e.g. kanban_db.connect() which is called on every
    kanban operation) log once per process, not once per call.  Different
    db_labels log independently, so state.db and kanban.db each get one error
    on the same NFS mount.

    Shared by :class:`SessionDB` and ``hermes_cli.kanban_db.connect`` so
    both databases get identical fallback behavior.

    Never downgrades to DELETE if the on-disk DB header reports WAL — see
    _on_disk_journal_mode.  That holds for both the NFS path and the
    WAL-reset vulnerability path.

    Fast-failing a turn on a SessionDB write error is deliberate (the

    send it again", while a full disk or read-only database needs the
    disk-space/permissions advice. Returns one of PERSISTENCE_ERROR_CAUSES:

    * ``"locked"``  — SQLite lock/busy contention (another process holds the
      database write lock); transient, retry-later guidance applies.
    * ``"compression"`` — a live compression lease refused the transcript
      write; the database itself is healthy and unlocked.
    * ``"compression_closed"`` — the write targeted a session already
      rotated (closed) by compression and no live continuation was adopted;
      the store is healthy — the client must refresh/adopt the new session
      id, so disk-space advice would be a misdiagnosis.
    * ``"turn_lease"`` — a presented session-turn-lease holder no longer
      owns the conversation (expired, released, or reclaimed); fail-fast
      fencing, not a storage fault.
    * ``"corrupt"`` — the database file itself is structurally damaged
      (``database disk image is malformed`` / SQLITE_NOTADB).  Distinct from
      ``"disk"``: freeing space cannot help, the user needs the repair path
      (``hermes doctor`` / automatic schema surgery).
    * ``"disk"``    — disk full / read-only / permission-shaped failures
      (delegates the disk-full patterns to :func:`is_disk_full_error` so the
      two classifiers can never drift apart — e.g. ENOSPC).

    write-corruption class (#50502) where base tables read fine and
    ``integrity_check`` passes but writes fail through the ``messages_fts*``
    triggers. Tries least-destructive recovery first and escalates:

      1. **Rebuild FTS indexes in place** via the FTS5 ``'rebuild'`` command,
         which rewrites the internal b-tree segments from the canonical
         ``messages`` rows without dropping or recreating anything. Fixes the
         FTS write-corruption class while preserving the schema intact.
      2. **De-duplicate** ``sqlite_master`` (keep the lowest rowid per
         ``type``/``name``). Fixes the canonical "table X already exists"
         case and PRESERVES the existing FTS index intact.
      3. **Drop the FTS schema** (every ``messages_fts*`` object) + ``VACUUM``.
         The next ``SessionDB()`` open rebuilds the FTS indexes from the
         canonical ``messages`` table.

# ── CJK-bigram FTS index (replaces the trigram index when available) ────
#
# The trigram tokenizer needs >=3 chars per query term, so 1-2 char CJK
# terms (ubiquitous in Korean/Chinese: 일본, 구글, 项目, ...) fall through
# to a LIKE full-table scan — measured 3-6s CPU per query on multi-GB
# installs and the dominant base cost of session_search on CJK workloads.
#
# ``cjk_unicode61`` (native/fts5_cjk/, a ~250-line loadable FTS5 tokenizer
# with no dependencies) wraps unicode61: maximal CJK runs are re-emitted as
# overlapping character bigrams (Lucene CJKAnalyzer semantics), everything
# else passes through unchanged. FTS5 phrase semantics turn a query term's
# consecutive bigrams into exact substring matching down to 2 chars at
# index speed. Contributed by Soju06 (PR #65544).
#
# Same v23 storage discipline as the trigram table it replaces:
# external-content over a tool-row-excluding view (zero inline text
# copies; tool rows stay searchable via ``messages_fts``), triggers gated
# on a DEDICATED marker pair (``fts_cjk_rebuild_high_water`` /
# ``fts_cjk_rebuild_progress``) so a cjk-only backfill — e.g. the
# trigram→cjk upgrade on an already-optimized DB — never gates the
# complete ``messages_fts`` index's triggers.
#
# The table exists ONLY when the loadable tokenizer is available
# (``~/.hermes/lib/libfts5_cjk.so``, built by ``native/fts5_cjk/build.sh``).
# A process that cannot load it self-heals by dropping the cjk triggers
# (message writes keep working; the index goes stale and is rebuilt by the
# next ``hermes sessions optimize-storage`` on a capable host).
#
# Split DDL: the table/view part is safe to ensure any time; the triggers
# are created ONLY while the index is complete-or-marker-gated. A stale
# index (trigger gap of unknown extent) must keep its triggers DROPPED —
# an external-content 'delete' op for a rowid the index never held is the
# canonical FTS5 index-corruption hazard the v23 marker gating exists to
# prevent.

    # Instead, we keep the SQLite timeout short (1s) and handle retries at the
    # application level with random jitter, which naturally staggers competing
    # writers and avoids the convoy.

    # Patience is TIME-based, not attempt-based.  A shared state.db is
    # legitimately held for multi-second stretches by sibling Hermes
    # processes: a TRUNCATE checkpoint at close on a large WAL, VACUUM after
    # an auto-prune, offline recovery, or an older still-running process
    # whose FTS maintenance predates the bounded-merge protocol (every
    # `hermes update` leaves mixed-version processes sharing the DB until
    # the old ones exit).  An attempt-counted budget (~15s incidental worst

        """Insert a session row, enriching NULL metadata on conflict.

        The gateway's ``get_or_create_session`` creates a bare row (source +
        user_id) *before* the agent exists; the agent's later
        ``create_session`` then carries the real ``model`` / ``model_config`` /
        ``system_prompt``. A plain ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` silently dropped that
        enrichment, leaving gateway sessions with NULL model/billing metadata.
        The ``ON CONFLICT`` upsert backfills those fields via ``COALESCE`` —
        only filling columns that are still NULL, never overwriting values an
        earlier writer already set (so a later bare call with source="unknown"
        can't clobber a real source/model).

        ``chat_id``/``thread_id`` record the messaging origin (the chat/room and
        thread the session was started in) so that gateway ``/resume`` can prove
        a persisted, now-inactive row belongs to the caller's chat/thread before
        switching to it (IDOR scoping — without them the ``sessions`` table has
        no chat/thread to compare).

        When ``parent_session_id`` is set (compression fork, delegate/subagent
        spawn, branch continuation) and this row's own ``cwd``/``git_repo_root``/
        ``git_branch``/``profile_name`` are still NULL after the insert, they are
        backfilled from the parent row. Callers of ``create_session`` for a child
        session historically didn't propagate these fields themselves (e.g. the
        compression-fork path), so a lineage could silently lose its working
        directory and drop out of the project sidebar every time it forked
        (#64709), or lose its owning profile and be aggregated as "default" every
        time it rotated or branched (the cross-profile session-jump bug). This
        only fills NULLs — an explicit value on the child is never overwritten.
        For compression forks specifically
        (parent ended with ``end_reason='compression'``), the gateway origin
        columns (``user_id``/``session_key``/``chat_id``/``chat_type``/
        ``thread_id``/``display_name``/``origin_json``) are inherited too, so a
        crash before the gateway re-records the peer can't strand the child
        without a recoverable routing mapping (#59527).

        """Find the latest recoverable gateway session for a routing peer.

        ``sessions.json`` is the fast routing index, but it can be missing or
        pruned after process-level restart bugs.  New gateway sessions persist
        the deterministic ``session_key`` on the durable session row so the
        mapping can be rebuilt exactly.  Rows ended only by older gateway
        cleanup's ``agent_close`` bug or a mistaken TUI ``ws_orphan_reap``
        (dashboard viewer disconnect before #60609) are treated as recoverable;
        explicit conversation boundaries such as /new, /resume switches, and
        compression splits are not.

        Ordering and emptiness (#82616): candidates are ranked by actual
        conversation recency (``last_activity_at``, falling back to
        ``started_at``) — ``started_at`` alone resurrected days-old zombie
        rows over the live conversation. Rows with messages are preferred,
        but an empty keyed row is still returned rather than ``None``:
        returning ``None`` mints a brand-new session id, which is a worse
        outcome than resuming an empty-but-correctly-keyed row (and "empty"
        may just mean the transcript lives under a compression child).

        Reset boundaries fence recovery (#68539): an intentional boundary
        such as ``session_reset`` (or any explicit non-recoverable
        end_reason) must block fallback to an *older* row for the same
        peer. Without the fence, the has-messages ranking above could reach
        behind a /new reset and silently restore the exact context the user
        reset. Each candidate is therefore rejected when a boundary row for
        the peer ended *after* the candidate's last activity — if the
        conversation's most recent event is an intentional reset, recovery
        returns nothing rather than reaching behind it.

        every surface reads the same membership instead of re-probing git in the

        probe failure never clobbers a previously-captured value.

        ``replace_git_meta`` inverts that non-empty rule: a deliberate workspace
        MOVE (re-homing a session into another project) must overwrite the old
        repo identity even when the new cwd resolves to none — keeping the stale
        root would leave the session grouped under the project it just left.

    # Atomic per-session locks that prevent two compression paths from
    # racing on the same session_id and producing orphan child sessions.
    #
    # The race: ``conversation_compression.py`` rotates ``agent.session_id``
    # as a side effect of a successful compression (end old session, create
    # new). That mutation is local to the AIAgent instance — but ``state.db``
    # is shared across all instances. Two AIAgents that share the same
    # ``session_id`` at the moment they both decide to compress (most
    # commonly the parent turn's agent + a background-review fork started
    # right after the turn ended) each end the parent and create their own
    # NEW session, parented to the same old id. The gateway SessionEntry
    # only catches one rotation; the other child silently accumulates
    # writes — Damien's "parent → two orphan children" repro shape.
    #
    # The lock is keyed by ``session_id`` and is held for the duration of
    # the compress() call plus the rotation. ``holder`` identifies the
    # current owner (pid:tid:nonce) for diagnostics; the lock is recovered
    # via ``expires_at`` if the holder process crashed without releasing.

        """List sessions with preview (first user message) and last active timestamp.

        Returns dicts with keys: id, source, model, title, started_at, ended_at,
        message_count, preview (first 60 chars of first user message),
        last_active (freshest of last_activity_at heartbeat and latest
        message timestamp, else started_at).

        Uses a single query with correlated subqueries instead of N+2 queries.

        By default, child sessions that represent implementation details
        (subagent runs, compression continuations) are excluded. User-visible
        branch and reset children remain listable. Pass ``include_children=True``
        to include every child.

        With ``project_compression_tips=True`` (default), sessions that are
        roots of compression chains are projected forward to their latest
        continuation — one logical conversation = one list entry, showing the
        live continuation's id/message_count/title/last_active. This prevents
        compressed continuations from being invisible to users while keeping
        delegate subagents and branches hidden. Pass ``False`` to return the
        raw root rows (useful for admin/debug UIs).

        Pass ``order_by_last_active=True`` to sort by most-recent activity
        instead of original conversation start time. For compression chains,
        the "most-recent activity" is taken from the live tip (not the root),
        so an old conversation that was compressed and continued recently
        surfaces in the correct slot. Ordering is computed at SQL level via
        a recursive CTE that walks compression-continuation edges, so LIMIT
        and OFFSET still apply efficiently.

        ``search_query`` matches case-insensitive substrings against each
        surfaced row's title and id (and, like ``id_query``, every title/id in
        its forward compression chain). A punctuation-stripped variant is also
        matched so e.g. ``an94`` finds ``AN-94``. Only honored in the
        ``order_by_last_active`` path.

        Pass ``compact_rows=True`` for dashboard and picker callers that only
        need lightweight metadata. This omits the ``system_prompt`` blob from
        the SELECT so SQLite never copies it out of the B-tree page — a
        significant I/O saving on large databases where the blob routinely
        runs to tens of kilobytes per row.

        Pass ``include_pinned=True`` to back-fill any conversation carrying the
        durable ``pinned`` flag that the LIMIT/OFFSET window left out. A pin is
        a "this must always be reachable" statement, so a pinned conversation
        aging past the requested page is a bug, not a paging outcome — the
        desktop sidebar would render an empty Pinned section. Back-filled rows
        obey the same filters (source, archived, min_message_count) as the
        page: an archived or filtered-out conversation stays out.

        Pass ``session_key`` to restrict results to one stable gateway
        conversation scope (DM, group, channel, or thread, including the
        configured per-user isolation policy).

        seeds can be thousands of rows; measured: 10k rows ≈ 2.4s inside one

        monopolize the write lock and starve concurrent writers). When set,

        recovery semantics as the old per-row loops (a mid-copy failure

        Used by transcript-rewrite flows such as /retry, /undo, and /compress.
        The delete + reinsert sequence must commit as one transaction so a
        mid-rewrite failure does not leave SQLite with a partial transcript.

        DESTRUCTIVE by default: every row for the session is DELETEd (and drops
        out of the FTS index). For compaction that must preserve the
        pre-compaction transcript under the same id, use
        :meth:`archive_and_compact` instead.

        Pass ``active_only=True`` to replace ONLY the live (``active = 1``) rows,
        leaving soft-archived rows (``active = 0`` — e.g. the ``compacted = 1``
        turns that :meth:`archive_and_compact` keeps on disk for #38763
        durability, or rewind/undo rows) untouched. Callers that share a session
        id with an agent already running in-place compaction must use this so a
        full-history rewrite doesn't wipe the rows the agent deliberately
        archived. ``message_count``/``tool_call_count`` then track the live set,
        matching :meth:`archive_and_compact`.

        Pass ``archive_dropped=True`` to SOFT-archive the live rows instead of
        DELETEing them: the replaced turns stay on disk with ``active = 0``,
        ``compacted = 0`` — the same "the user took it back" marking
        :meth:`rewind_to_message` applies — and stay readable via
        :meth:`get_messages` with ``include_inactive=True``. This is the mode a
        rewind/edit/regenerate must use: those flows overwrite a transcript the
        user may not have meant to drop, and a plain DELETE also evicts the rows
        from the FTS index, leaving nothing to recover from (#82756). It implies
        active-only handling — already-archived rows are never touched — so
        ``active_only`` is redundant with it. The rewritten set is inserted as
        fresh active rows exactly as in the destructive path, so the live view

        transaction. The conversation keeps ONE session id for life (#38763)
        WITHOUT destroying history:

        - The live-context load (:meth:`get_messages_as_conversation`,

          reloads ONLY the compacted set.

          DISCOVERABLE: they are marked compacted=1, and search_messages()
          includes compacted=1 rows by default — so session_search still finds
          them, unlike rewind/undo rows (active=0, compacted=0) which stay
          hidden. They remain in the FTS index (the messages_fts* triggers
          index on INSERT / drop on DELETE and don't key on active/compacted;
          flipping to active=0 is a content-preserving UPDATE) and are
          recoverable via get_messages(..., include_inactive=True).

        Concurrent-append safety (#75316): when *watermark* is provided (the
        value of :meth:`get_active_message_watermark` captured at compression
        START), rows that arrived during the slow provider summary call
        (``id > watermark``) are NOT summarized away. They are re-sequenced
        after the compacted set by a pure-SQL column clone (every column
        except ``id`` — content, api_content, platform_message_id, token
        counts, reasoning sidecars all survive byte-exact, and the FTS
        triggers index the clones naturally), and the originals are archived.
        NOTE: re-sequencing assigns the tail rows fresh ids; consumers that
        reference durable row ids re-resolve by content (see 3e8ab0610).
        ``watermark=None`` preserves the historical archive-everything
        behavior.

        Commit-fence safety: when *lock_holder* is provided, the commit
        verifies INSIDE the transaction that the compression lock is still
        held by that holder and unexpired — a compression whose lease was
        reclaimed (crash cleanup, TTL expiry, competing writer) fails the
        commit instead of clobbering the winner's transcript.

        ``message_count`` is set to the ACTIVE count after commit, matching
        what the live load returns. ``model_config_patch`` is merged into the
        session's JSON config in the same transaction; a ``None`` value

        by in-place context compaction (``active=0, compacted=1``). Those are
        durable display history, not soft-deleted rows — a user-visible
        transcript read must not drop them, or earlier turns silently become
        unreachable once the UI exhausts its active-only window. Soft-deleted
        Undo/Rewind rows (``active=0, compacted=0``) stay excluded; use
        ``include_inactive`` for those.

        Ordered by AUTOINCREMENT id (true insertion order) rather than
        timestamp — see c03acca50 for the WSL2 clock-regression rationale.

        When ``limit`` is provided, returns at most ``limit`` messages
        starting from ``offset`` (0-based, in insertion order). Enables
        pagination for the API endpoint to avoid loading entire transcripts.
        With ``latest=True``, the offset is measured back from the newest
        message and the selected page is still returned in chronological
        order. ``offset`` alone (without ``limit``) also pages — SQLite
        requires a LIMIT clause for OFFSET, so it's emitted as ``LIMIT -1``
        (unbounded).

        ``after_id`` enables keyset pagination (``id > after_id``): O(1)
        page seeks on huge transcripts where OFFSET degrades to O(n) per
        page. Ascending order only (incompatible with ``latest``/``offset``).

        The target message itself becomes inactive as well so the caller

        twice in the replayed transcript.  Rewound rows are kept on
        disk with ``active=0`` for audit / forensic inspection — use
        :meth:`get_messages` with ``include_inactive=True`` to see them.

        Returns a dict::
