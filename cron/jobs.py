# Cron is per-profile by design (issue #4707). Each profile owns its own cron
# store under its own HERMES_HOME, and a profile-scoped gateway runs that
# profile's jobs under that same HERMES_HOME — so a job authored in profile
# `coder` lives in `~/.hermes/profiles/coder/cron/jobs.json` and executes with
# `coder`'s `.env`, `config.yaml`, and skills. We deliberately anchor on
# `get_hermes_home()` (the active profile home), NOT `get_default_hermes_root()`
# (the shared root). Anchoring at the root would funnel every profile's jobs
# into one shared `jobs.json` and run them under whatever HERMES_HOME the
# ticker process happens to have — leaking config/credentials/skills across
# profiles (the security boundary #4707 was filed for). Do NOT change this to
# the default root: that re-breaks per-profile isolation. See also the dynamic
# `_get_hermes_home()` / `_get_lock_paths()` resolution in cron/scheduler.py.

    Create a new cron job.

    Args:
        prompt: The prompt to run (must be self-contained, or a task instruction when skill is set).
                Ignored when ``no_agent=True`` except as an optional name hint.
        schedule: Schedule string (see parse_schedule)
        name: Optional friendly name
        repeat: How many times to run (None = forever, 1 = once)
        deliver: Where to deliver output ("origin", "local", "telegram", etc.)
        origin: Source info where job was created (for "origin" delivery)
        skill: Optional legacy single skill name to load before running the prompt
        skills: Optional ordered list of skills to load before running the prompt
        model: Optional per-job model override
        provider: Optional per-job provider override
        base_url: Optional per-job base URL override
        script: Optional path to a script whose stdout feeds the job. With
                ``no_agent=True`` the script IS the job — its stdout is
                delivered verbatim. Without ``no_agent``, its stdout is
                injected into the agent's prompt as context (data-collection /
                change-detection pattern). Paths resolve under
                ~/.hermes/scripts/; ``.sh`` / ``.bash`` files run via bash,
                anything else via Python.
        context_from: Optional job ID (or list of job IDs) whose most recent output
                      is injected into the prompt as context before each run.
                      Useful for chaining cron jobs: job A finds data, job B processes it.
        enabled_toolsets: Optional list of toolset names to restrict the agent to.
                          When set, only tools from these toolsets are loaded, reducing
                          token overhead. When omitted, all default tools are loaded.
                          Ignored when ``no_agent=True``.
        workdir: Optional absolute path.  When set, the job runs as if launched
                from that directory: AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / .cursorrules from
                that directory are injected into the system prompt, and the
                terminal/file/code_exec tools use it as their working directory
                (via TERMINAL_CWD).  When unset, the old behaviour is preserved
                (no context files injected, tools use the scheduler's cwd).
                With ``no_agent=True``, ``workdir`` is still applied as the
                script's cwd so relative paths inside the script behave
                predictably.
        no_agent: When True, skip the agent entirely — run ``script`` on schedule
                and deliver its stdout directly. Empty stdout = silent (no
                delivery). Requires ``script`` to be set. Ideal for classic
                watchdogs and periodic alerts that don't need LLM reasoning.
        monitor_script: Optional path to a cheap monitor source script (same
                resolution/containment rules as ``script``: relative to
                ~/.hermes/scripts/, .sh/.bash via bash, else Python). Each
                tick the script runs FIRST and its output is hashed as exact
                bytes: unchanged output suppresses the agent run entirely
                (recorded as a silent 'no_change' tick); changed output
                injects a MONITOR CHANGE DETECTED block (unified diff + new
                output) into the prompt before a normal agent run. Scripts
                should emit stable output (no timestamps). Mutually exclusive
                with ``monitor_url``; incompatible with ``no_agent=True``.
        monitor_url: Optional http(s) URL used as the monitor source instead
                of a script — fetched with a bounded GET each tick. Same
                hash-suppression semantics as ``monitor_script``.
        reasoning_effort: Optional per-job reasoning effort pin. One of the
                canonical Hermes levels (none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|
                max|ultra, case-insensitive). When set, it wins over BOTH the
                global ``agent.reasoning_effort`` and per-model
                ``agent.reasoning_overrides`` at fire time. Capability is NOT
                validated here: levels above what the resolved model supports
                are clamped or omitted by the provider transport at send time,
                exactly like config-set effort. Inert with ``no_agent=True``
                (no LLM call to configure). None/empty = unset (job follows
                config resolution, pre-existing behavior).

    missed runs are collapsed — ``next_run_at`` is fast-forwarded to the next

    """Rewrite cron job skill references after a curator consolidation pass.

    When the curator consolidates a skill X into umbrella Y (or archives X
    as pruned), any cron job that lists ``X`` in its ``skills`` field will
    fail to load ``X`` at run time — the scheduler logs a warning and
    skips the skill, so the job runs without the instructions it was
    scheduled to follow. See cron/scheduler.py where ``skill_view`` is
    called per skill name.

    This function repairs cron jobs in-place:

    - A skill listed in ``consolidated`` is replaced with its umbrella
      target (the ``into`` value). If the umbrella is already in the
      job's skill list, the stale name is dropped without duplication.
    - A skill listed in ``pruned`` is dropped outright — there is no
      forwarding target.
    - Ordering and other skills in the list are preserved.
    - The legacy ``skill`` field is realigned via ``_apply_skill_fields``.

    Args:
        consolidated: mapping of ``old_skill_name -> umbrella_skill_name``.
        pruned: list of skill names that were archived with no forwarding
            target.

    Returns a report dict::
