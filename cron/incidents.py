"""Durable cron failure incidents with signature dedup and ack.

The executions ledger (``cron.executions``) records every attempt; this module
groups the *failures* into durable incidents keyed by ``(job_id, error
signature)`` so the same job failing with the same error does not re-ping the
operator every run once they have acknowledged it.

Lifecycle: ``detected`` → ``alerted`` → ``closed``. Closing
(acking) an incident is per-signature: the same job + same normalized error
keeps resolving to the SAME incident id, so a closed incident stays closed (no
re-alert) until the error text changes, which mints a brand-new incident.
``detected`` means the failure was recorded; ``alerted`` means at least one
failure ping for the signature actually reached the operator. Richer states
(e.g. a dv9.6 ``reviewed``) are deliberately NOT reserved here — state
validity lives in ``INCIDENT_STATES`` (Python), not a SQLite CHECK, exactly
so a future slice can add states without a table rebuild.

Incidents live in the SAME ``cron/executions.db`` as ``cron.executions`` so
there is one durable cron store per profile. The schema is lazily created on
connect and a missing database never raises (directories are created).
