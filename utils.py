    replaced with a regular file — silently detaching managed deployments
    that symlink ``config.yaml`` / ``SOUL.md`` / ``auth.json`` etc. from
    ``~/.hermes/`` to a git-tracked profile package or dotfiles repo
    (GitHub #16743).

    the real file in-place while the symlink survives.  For non-symlink
    and non-existent paths the behavior is identical to a plain
    ``os.replace`` call unless the rename fails with:

    * ``EXDEV`` / ``EBUSY`` (any platform) — cross-device, bind-mount, and

    comments, key order, quotes, and readable Unicode survive.

    Reconciliation rules against the on-disk YAML:

    * Keys present in both are updated in-place via assignment, which keeps
      ruamel's CommentedMap anchors (and their attached comments) attached to
      their original positions.
    * Keys missing from ``new_state`` are deleted.
    * Keys added in ``new_state`` are appended at the end of their parent map.
    * Nested ``dict`` values recurse with the same rules.
    * Non-dict values (lists, scalars) are overwritten wholesale — list
      element comments are not individually preserved, matching ruamel's
      semantics.

    This is the comment-safe replacement for ``yaml.safe_dump(cfg, f)`` in
    callers that mutate a deep-loaded config dict and want to persist the
    whole thing.

    Shares the fail-closed contract ``hermes_cli.config.atomic_config_write``
    enforces for plain (non-comment-preserving) full-document writes: an
    existing-but-unreadable ``config.yaml`` (permission error, broken mount,
    transient I/O) raises rather than being silently replaced with only
    ``new_state``. Imported lazily to avoid a module-level circular import —
