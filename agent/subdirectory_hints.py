"""Progressive subdirectory hint discovery.

As the agent navigates into subdirectories via tool calls (read_file, terminal,
search_files, etc.), this module discovers and loads project context files
(AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules) from those directories.  Discovered hints
are appended to the tool result so the model gets relevant context at the moment
it starts working in a new area of the codebase.

This complements the startup context loading in ``prompt_builder.py`` which only
loads from the CWD.  Subdirectory hints are discovered lazily and injected into
the conversation without modifying the system prompt (preserving prompt caching).

Inspired by Block/goose's SubdirectoryHintTracker.
