"""Canonical reasoning-effort vocabulary and wire clamping.

Hermes' internal effort ladder (``hermes_constants.VALID_REASONING_EFFORTS``
plus the ``none`` disable level) is wider than what any single provider wire
accepts. Historically every transport and provider profile hand-rolled its own
translation map, and the class of bugs that produced was constant: a new
internal level (``ultra``) leaking to a wire that rejects it with HTTP 400
(#89503, #70058), or an unknown level being dropped to a weak default so the
strongest ask resolved *weaker* than an explicit ``high`` — a ladder
inversion (#74295, #87279).

This module is the single source of truth both kinds of code use instead:

- :data:`EFFORT_LADDER` — canonical low→high ordering.
- :func:`clamp_effort` — the one clamping policy: keep a supported level
  verbatim, otherwise take the **nearest weaker** supported level (never
  silently escalate cost above what was asked), and only when nothing weaker
  exists take the weakest supported level (a provider whose minimum thinking
  level is ``high`` serves ``high`` for a ``low`` ask — GLM-5.2's shape).
- Named wire-vocabulary constants for the common OpenAI-compatible surfaces,
  so call sites declare *data* ("this route accepts these levels") rather
  than logic.

Rules for call sites:

1. **Wire shape stays local.** Whether a route wants ``extra_body.reasoning``,
   a top-level ``reasoning_effort`` string, or a ``thinking`` toggle is the
   caller's business. Only the *vocabulary math* lives here.
2. **Unset stays unset.** ``clamp_effort`` translates an explicit request; it
   does not invent one. When the user expressed no effort, prefer omitting
   the field so the server default applies.
3. **Never patch a predicate.** When a provider rejects a level, fix its
   declared supported set (data), never add another vendor-name special case
   at the call site.
