"""Global emergency stop (ESTOP) — a resumable pause for NEW work only.

``hermes pause`` writes a sentinel file at ``$HERMES_HOME/ESTOP``;
``hermes resume`` removes it. While the sentinel exists:

* the cron scheduler skips dispatching due jobs (``cron/scheduler.py:tick``),
* the embedded kanban dispatcher skips spawning workers
  (``gateway/kanban_watchers.py``),
* new gateway turns get a brief "Hermes is paused" reply instead of an
  agent run (``gateway/run.py:_handle_message``).

In-flight work is NEVER killed — this is pause-new-work, not panic/exit.
The check is one or two ``os.stat`` calls (process home + fleet root when
they differ) so callers may run it every tick; no caching beyond the OS is
performed, so engaging/disengaging takes effect on the very next check.

The sentinel body is optional JSON ``{"reason": ..., "engaged_at": ...}``.
A corrupt or empty file still counts as engaged (fail safe): the pause must
hold even if the file was created by ``touch ~/.hermes/ESTOP``.

Ported from: gastownhall/gastown estop.go (MIT). Related prior art:
#26778 (/panic — kill/exit semantics; deliberately different, ours is
resumable) and #44617 (interrupting in-flight cron; deliberately out of
scope here).
