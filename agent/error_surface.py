"""Structured error-surface descriptors for UI clients (Desktop/TUI).

Maps the internal failure taxonomy (``agent.error_classifier.FailoverReason``
values carried in turn results as ``failure_reason``, or raw exceptions from
the turn dispatcher) onto a small, stable wire descriptor:

    {"layer": <ui layer>, "code": <specific code>, "retryable": <bool>}

The *layer* names which part of the stack failed, so clients can say
"Provider error" / "Gateway error" instead of toasting an opaque string and
leaving the user to guess whether the model, the gateway, or the app froze:

    provider   — the model/provider API rejected or failed the call
    endpoint   — a user-configured custom/local endpoint failed (transport)
    streaming  — the provider's SSE/stream connection dropped mid-turn
    auth       — authentication/authorization failed
    billing    — credits/quota wall (clients usually have a richer
                 billing_block descriptor; this is the fallback signal)
    gateway    — the local gateway/agent runtime itself errored
    runtime    — agent initialization / local environment failure
    disk       — local disk full / persistence failure

This module is intentionally dependency-light and NEVER raises: surfacing
diagnostics must not be able to break the error path it describes. Clients
treat the descriptor as advisory — an absent or partial descriptor falls
back to today's string-sniffing behavior (older backends keep working).
