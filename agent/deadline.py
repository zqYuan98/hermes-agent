"""Unified deadline layer — one bounded-execution primitive, one timeout resolver.

Phase 1 of the architectural fix for the timeout/hang backlog
(https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/85125).

The tree currently carries at least six site-local deadline mechanisms, each
built for one incident, none shared (tool_executor batch deadline, telegram
``_await_with_thread_deadline``, gateway turn lease, reasoning stale floors,
``human_wait_ceiling``, per-MCP-handler timeouts).  Every new stall report
grows that list by one.  This module is the shared foundation the call sites
migrate onto in later phases:

* :func:`resolve_timeout` — one config-first resolution path for timeout
  values (``timeouts:`` section in config.yaml > legacy env var > default),
  so new surfaces stop inventing ``HERMES_*_TIMEOUT`` env vars (".env is for
  secrets only") and hardcoded literals stop ignoring user config
  (#63302, #53161, #43272 class).

* :func:`clamp_timeout` — platform-safe clamping.  Large user-supplied
  timeouts overflow ``time_t`` inside ``threading.Lock.acquire(timeout=...)``
  / ``Thread.join(timeout=...)`` on macOS and kill whole tool batches
  (#83220).  Clamping at the shared boundary fixes that class once, for
  every consumer.

* :func:`run_bounded_async` — a wall-clock deadline for awaitables that does
  NOT depend on event-loop timers.  ``asyncio.wait_for`` schedules its expiry
  on the loop; when the loop thread itself is blocked in a synchronous call
  (family A of the #84047 stall triage), every asyncio-based timeout in the
  process is silently disabled.  This helper drives the deadline from a
  daemon ``threading.Timer`` (generalizing the proven telegram-adapter
  primitive) and abandons cancellation-shielded tasks instead of waiting for
  cancellation to complete.  The telegram adapter's private copy
  (``plugins/platforms/telegram/adapter.py:_await_with_thread_deadline``)
  migrates onto this in Phase 2 of #85125 — do not let the two drift in the
  meantime; fix bugs here first.

* :func:`run_bounded_sync` — the same contract for synchronous callables
  bounded from a synchronous context (daemon worker thread, abandoned on
  expiry).

* :func:`kill_process_tree` — portable whole-tree termination so
  kill-on-timeout stops orphaning descendants (#71148, #59549, #84967,
  #68139 class).  Existing site-local tree-kills that migrate onto this in
  Phase 4 of #85125: ``gateway/status.py`` (taskkill wrapper + psutil
  snapshot/reap pair) and ``tools/code_execution_tool.py`` (psutil
  recursive children kill).

Design invariants:

* Exceptions raised by the bounded operation propagate unchanged — callers
  keep their existing error handling.  Only the *timeout* outcome is
  reified (as :class:`BoundedResult`), because that is the outcome the
  call sites keep getting wrong.
* A timeout produced by this layer is OUR deadline, not the provider's.
  Callers that feed errors into ``agent/error_classifier.py`` should
  classify :class:`DeadlineExpired` distinctly from transport timeouts
  (the #59549 / #80323 misattribution class).
* ``None`` timeout means unbounded, and non-positive resolved values are
  normalized to ``None`` (matching the existing
  ``HERMES_CONCURRENT_TOOL_TIMEOUT_S`` convention).

def kill_process_tree(pid: int, *, sig: Optional[int] = None) -> bool:
    """Terminate ``pid`` and all its descendants, portably.

    Kill-on-timeout that signals only the direct child orphans process trees
    (cron scripts, in-container shells, browser daemons — #71148 class).

    * Windows: ``taskkill /F /T`` terminates the tree (``sig`` ignored;
      Windows has no equivalent). Console-window flash is suppressed via
      ``windows_hide_flags`` and the exit code is checked, so a dead or
      inaccessible PID reports ``False`` like the POSIX path.
    * POSIX: the descendant set is snapshotted via psutil (a hard
      dependency) BEFORE any signal — once the parent dies its children are
      reparented and can no longer be found by a parent walk. Then the
      process group is signalled when ``pid`` leads one (covers
      grandchildren in the same session in one syscall), and every
      snapshotted descendant is signalled individually — which also reaches
      descendants that created their OWN sessions (a child that called
      ``setsid``, exactly what user shell commands do; see
      tools/environments/base.py). ``sig`` defaults to ``SIGKILL``.
      psutil's identity-aware ``Process`` (PID + create time) means a
      recycled PID is never signalled.

    Returns True when the target (or any of its tree) was signalled, False
    when the process was already gone or every termination call failed.
