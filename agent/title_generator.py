"""Auto-generate short session titles from the user's opening message.

Two stages, both off the critical path:

1. **Instant** — a deterministic title derived from the first user message,
   written before the model is even called. Costs nothing, cannot fail, and
   means a session is named the moment it starts instead of after the first
   turn finishes (which measured p50 151s / p90 1212s on real sessions).
2. **Upgrade** — one small-model call that replaces the derived title with a
   proper one. Runs on a cheap/fast tier, with thinking disabled and the
   response constrained to a JSON object, so there is no reasoning preamble to
   strip and nothing to parse out of prose.

Provenance (``derived`` < ``llm`` < ``user``) is enforced by the storage layer,
so stage 2 can only ever replace stage 1, and neither can replace a name the
user typed. That ordering is the industry-standard one — Codex CLI encodes the
same ``custom > ai > fallback`` precedence in its session importer.
