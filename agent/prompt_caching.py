"""Anthropic prompt caching strategy.

The default layout uses 4 cache_control breakpoints: the static system
prefix, the end of the system prompt, and the last 2 non-system messages.
When a static system prefix is unavailable, it falls back to one system
breakpoint plus the last 3 messages. All markers use the same TTL (5m or 1h).
This preserves intra-session caching while allowing new sessions to reuse the
stable system-prompt prefix.

Pure functions -- no class state, no AIAgent dependency.

    """Apply Anthropic cache-control markers to API messages.

    When ``static_system_prefix`` exactly matches the beginning of a string
    system prompt, it receives an early marker and the full system prompt gets
    a trailing marker. The remaining two markers target the latest cacheable
    non-system messages. Without that prefix, the legacy system-and-3 layout
    is retained.

    Idempotent: pre-existing ``cache_control`` markers are stripped from a
    per-message copy before new ones are placed, so calling this twice (or
    handing it messages a prior call already marked) can never accumulate
    past 4 markers. Only messages that already carry a marker pay the copy
    cost — a shallow top-level copy suffices because
    :func:`strip_anthropic_cache_control` is copy-on-write on content parts —
    and the rest of the copy-on-write contract is unchanged (#90971).

    ``tool_part_markers=False`` (LiteLLM-style envelope routes, #89886)
    keeps markers off role:tool messages entirely; the breakpoint budget
    reallocates to the nearest eligible non-tool message.

    Returns:
        Shallow copy of message list with selective deep copies of modified messages.
