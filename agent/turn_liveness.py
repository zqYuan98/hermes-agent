"""Turn liveness watchdog (#95548): force-abort turns that stall silently.

A conversation turn can stall mid-flight (observed in #95548 between
"model returned tool_calls" and tool execution, after a slow model
response + desktop WS disconnect) with no error logged, no further
progress, and the durable session turn lease kept renewing — so nothing
ever force-aborts the turn and the session stays stuck until the process
is killed.

This module owns the watchdog policy end to end:

* configuration — :func:`resolve_turn_liveness_settings` reads the
  ``agent.turn_liveness`` section of config.yaml and validates it;
* state machine — :class:`TurnLivenessWatchdog` samples the agent's
  activity clock and drives the stall decision;
* thread mechanics — the polling loop, stop handling, and the stall
  commit point.

``AIAgent.run_conversation`` (``run_agent.py``) keeps only the smallest
integration seam: it resolves the settings, supplies the commit and
deactivate callbacks that own turn-lease state, and starts the thread
next to the durable lease refresher.

Config surface (config.yaml)::

    agent:
      turn_liveness:
        timeout_s: 600.0   # idle bound; <= 0 disables the watchdog
        poll_s: 15.0       # sampling interval (seconds)

Both values are validated. A non-numeric typo, ``NaN``, or ``Inf`` logs a
warning and falls back to the documented default — it never crashes
startup, and a bogus value can never silently disable the watchdog
(``NaN``) or freeze the watcher thread (``Inf`` poll).

Race safety (#95663 review): the watchdog samples the activity clock and
binds the abort decision to the observed ``(generation, timestamp)`` pair.
The commit callback revalidates that pair under the *same* lock
``AIAgent._touch_activity`` uses to stamp the clock, so a turn that
resumed while the stall was being logged/emitted is never hard-cancelled
— it continues and its lease keeps renewing. The revalidated generation
is carried into ``AIAgent.interrupt`` (``require_generation``) as a
cancellation claim consumed at the final mutation edge: ``interrupt``
reserves the claim under the activity lock, ``_touch_activity``
invalidates the reservation the instant real progress lands, and the
claim survives every blocking boundary, including the compression
commit fence. Claim consumption and the first observable interrupt
state publish in ONE activity-lock critical section, so a turn that
resumes can only ever interleave before that section (the reservation
is invalidated and the abort declines) or after it (the interrupt
already committed under the lock) — never between "claim consumed" and
"state published". A turn that resumes anywhere in the window is never
hard-cancelled, and an exceptional interrupt path declines the abort
fail-closed instead of mutating interrupt state.
