"""Mint a provider API key by running a command (``key_cmd``).

Static API keys are the exception at enterprise gateways: SSO/OIDC brokers,
cloud IAM, and internal auth proxies all issue SHORT-LIVED bearers instead.
A key copied into ``.env`` (``key_env``) is stale within the hour, so every
request after that 401s and the user has to restart the session.

``key_cmd`` names a command that PRINTS a token, so the credential is derived
rather than stored::

    providers:
      my-gateway:
        base_url: https://gateway.internal.example.com/v1
        api_mode: chat_completions
        key_cmd: my-auth-cli print-token --profile prod

This is the established pattern for agent tooling — Claude Code's
``apiKeyHelper``, the ``gcloud auth print-access-token`` / ``aws ecr
get-login-password`` idiom, and vendor helpers such as ``databricks auth
token`` all expose exactly this contract. Hermes already accepts a callable
API key on both wire clients (the Entra ID / Azure identity path) and invokes
it per request, so nothing downstream changes: the token is simply always
fresh. It is cached until shortly before expiry, so the command runs about
once per token lifetime rather than once per request.

Output contract: print ONLY the token on stdout, either bare or as JSON with
an ``access_token`` field (``expires_in`` is honoured when present) — the
shape OAuth 2.0 token endpoints and the helpers above already emit.

Precedence: an explicit ``--api-key`` still wins (the one-off recovery escape
hatch); otherwise ``key_cmd`` is preferred over a static ``api_key`` /
``key_env`` on the same entry.
