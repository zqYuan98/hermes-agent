"""Anthropic credential sources, OAuth flows, and token resolution.

Extracted from ``agent/anthropic_adapter.py``: the adapter is a message/HTTP
translation layer, while everything below owns *where an Anthropic credential
comes from* and *how a rotated one is committed*. Keeping the two apart means
the refresh transaction has a single home instead of being interleaved with
request building.

Sources, in the order ``resolve_anthropic_token()`` consults them:

1. ``ANTHROPIC_TOKEN`` / ``CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`` (explicit OAuth env)
2. ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` (explicit API key)
3. ``~/.hermes/.anthropic_oauth.json`` (Hermes PKCE login)
4. ``~/.claude/.credentials.json`` / macOS Keychain (Claude Code)
5. the credential pool in ``auth.json``

Sources 3 and 4 are *singletons*: ``credential_pool._seed_from_singletons()``
re-reads them on every ``load_pool()`` and writes what it finds over the pool
row, which is why a failed write here is a failed refresh (see
``CredentialPersistError``) rather than a best-effort cache miss.

``agent.anthropic_adapter`` re-exports every public name below, so existing
``from agent.anthropic_adapter import resolve_anthropic_token`` imports keep
working.
