"""Background memory/skill review — fork the agent to evaluate the turn.

After every turn, ``AIAgent.run_conversation`` may call
:func:`spawn_background_review` to fire off a daemon thread that replays
the conversation snapshot in a forked :class:`AIAgent` and asks itself
"should any skill/memory be saved or updated?".  Writes go straight to
the memory + skill stores.  Main conversation and prompt cache are never
touched.

The fork inherits the parent's live runtime (provider, model, base_url,
credentials, cached system prompt) so it hits the same prefix cache and
uses the same auth.  It runs with a tool whitelist limited to memory and
skill management tools; everything else is denied at runtime.

See the ``hermes-agent-dev`` skill (``references/self-improvement-loop.md``)
for invariants and PR review criteria.

    "**Skills**: how to do this class of task. Be ACTIVE — most "

    "skill_view during this review — see Read-before-write below). "

    "  2. UPDATE AN EXISTING UMBRELLA (skills_list + skill_view to "

    "  3. ADD A SUPPORT FILE under an existing umbrella via "

    "Name at the class level — NOT a PR number, error string, "

    # The fix is detachment, not disablement:

    #     (``if agent._session_db:``) skips every durable write and
    #     compaction can only ever rewrite the fork's private
    #     in-memory transcript.
    #   • The compressor's OWN session binding still needs severing:
    #     AIAgent.__init__ bound it to the parent's SessionDB and
    #     session_id before this function nulled the agent-level
    #     binding, so durable cooldown/streak/ineffective-count
    #     writes would otherwise land on the parent's row. Rebinding
    #     with session_db=None / session_id="" makes every
    #     compressor persist guard a no-op.
    #   • Force in-place mode (never rotation) even if the parent's
    #     config selected rotation, and re-enable compression ONLY
    #     after the rebind succeeds (fail-closed — see below). While
    #     enabled, both compression gates stay deferred until the

    of ``run_agent.threading.Thread`` keep working.

    the user asked for while keeping the same guardrails. Automatic
    post-turn reviews pass ``None`` — their prompts are byte-identical to
    before this parameter existed.

    read once here and shared with the worker (aux routing) so a single
