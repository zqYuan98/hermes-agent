"""RelayAdapter — one generic gateway adapter fronted by the connector. EXPERIMENTAL.

A single ``BasePlatformAdapter`` subclass that, at handshake, receives a
``CapabilityDescriptor`` from the connector telling it which platform it is
fronting and which capabilities to advertise to the ``GatewayStreamConsumer``.
It implements the four abstract methods (``connect`` / ``disconnect`` / ``send``
/ ``get_chat_info``) plus the capability surface (``MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH``,
``message_len_fn``, ``supports_draft_streaming``) by delegating wire I/O to an
injected transport and reading capabilities off the descriptor.

There is NO per-platform gateway code: the connector is the only side that knows
"this chat_id maps to a Discord channel, send it via the Discord websocket."
The gateway sees an ordinary ``MessageEvent`` in and calls ``adapter.send`` out.

EXPERIMENTAL: the transport protocol and descriptor schema may change without a
deprecation cycle until >=2 Class-1 platforms validate them.

        A DM turn's streaming reply is sent with ``reply_to`` = the triggering
        message's ts (the stream consumer's ``initial_reply_to_id``, used as the
        edit anchor and, on threading platforms, the reply target). The
        connector's slackRestSender maps a raw ``reply_to`` to a Slack
        ``thread_ts``, so a plain DM reply would be posted THREADED under the
        user's message instead of flat at the DM root — and a threaded first
        send loses the progressive edit-streaming the user sees in a real
        thread (the reported symptom: DM/home replies arrive flat, no
        progressive edits).

        Native Slack Hermes already suppresses this synthetic DM thread anchor:
        ``SlackAdapter._resolve_thread_ts`` returns ``None`` for a top-level /
        DM message when ``reply_in_thread`` is off. The relay lane has no such
        disambiguation, so we reproduce it here. run.py already encodes the
        real-thread decision in ``metadata["thread_id"]`` (it is set only when
        progress threading is active — a real thread, or channel autoThread);
        for a DM with no real thread that key is absent. So the rule is:

          Slack DM + no real ``thread_id`` in metadata  ⇒  drop ``reply_to``.

        This posts the reply flat at the DM root and lets the consumer edit its
        own first-send ts — streaming works exactly as in a thread. It does NOT:
          * reintroduce a synthetic DM thread_id (#18859 / the /sethome
            landmine) — it removes an anchor, never adds one;
          * regress real-thread streaming — a real thread carries a distinct
            ``thread_id`` in metadata, so the guard leaves ``reply_to`` alone;
          * regress channel autoThread — a channel/group top-level reply carries
            ``thread_id`` (the message's own ts) in metadata when threading is
            on, so it is left alone; and a non-DM chat is never matched here.

          3. Anchor promotion: the connector's Slack sender THREADS ON METADATA
             ONLY — ``threadTs()`` reads ``metadata.thread_id``/``thread_ts``
             and never looks at the frame's ``reply_to``. A surviving anchor is

        The base class spawns ``_keep_typing`` for every adapter (a 2s refresh
        loop for the life of the turn), but the relay adapter inherited the
        base no-op ``send_typing`` — so hosted/relay chats never showed
        "is typing…" even though the wire contract (``OutboundOp "typing"``)
        and every connector-side sender (Discord ``POST /channels/{id}/typing``,
        Telegram ``sendChatAction``, Signal ``sendTyping``, Slack assistant
        status) already implement it. This bridges the loop's tick onto the
        existing outbound frame.

        Two details are load-bearing, mirroring ``send()``:
          - ``_with_scope``: the connector's egress guard wraps ALL ops
            (routedEgressGuard), so a typing frame without a resolvable tenant
            discriminator (metadata.scope_id, or user_id for DMs) is declined
            exactly like a bare send would be.
          - the per-frame ``platform`` tag (Phase 1.5): a multi-platform
            gateway must egress typing through the platform the chat lives on.

        Best-effort: failures are swallowed (``_keep_typing`` already treats
        send_typing errors as non-fatal, and an older connector that rejects
        the op just returns an unsuccessful result we ignore). Each call is
        one-shot — Discord/Telegram indicators self-expire and need no cleanup;
        Slack Assistant status persists, so ``stop_typing`` below sends an
        explicit clear for Slack only.

        out ambiguous -> plain-send fallback (the duplicate final).

        Acks are cosmetic by contract (the audit trail), so they ride a
        background task: the handler returns immediately, the read loop
        keeps consuming, and the ack's own result frame resolves normally.
