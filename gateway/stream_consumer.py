"""Gateway streaming consumer — bridges sync agent callbacks to async platform delivery.

The agent fires stream_delta_callback(text) synchronously from its worker thread.
GatewayStreamConsumer:
  1. Receives deltas via on_delta() (thread-safe, sync)
  2. Queues them to an asyncio task via queue.Queue
  3. The async run() task buffers, rate-limits, and progressively edits
     a single message on the target platform

Design: Uses the edit transport (send initial message, then editMessageText).
This is universally supported across Telegram, Discord, and Slack.

    everything after the orphaned fence to render as a single code block.
    The same problem applies to inline-code spans closed by a single
    backtick: an orphaned `` ` `` makes the remainder of the message
    render as inline code.

    Triple-backtick: count `` ``` `` occurrences.  If odd, append a

    triple-backtick fences (e.g. a literal `` ``` `` inside a code block)

        clarify decision prompt.  Queues a boundary signal that the consumer
        processes serially: finalize the current stream with accumulated text
        (creating a stable message for pre-prompt content), then handle
        post-prompt output per ``reopen``.

        ``placeholder`` is the finalize text used only when there is no
        accumulated content yet (the prompt fired as the agent's first action).
        Defaults to the approval placeholder; clarify passes its own so the
        finalized bubble doesn't read "waiting for approval" for a question.

        ``reason`` is a human-readable label ("Approval"/"Clarify") used only
        for the boundary handler's log prefixes so a clarify boundary doesn't
        surface as an "Approval boundary" failure during troubleshooting.

        ``reopen`` controls post-prompt delivery.  False (approval): disable
        native streaming and buffer post-prompt output into a single reliable
        send() — approval waits are long and unbounded, so the stream may go
        stale.  True (clarify): keep native streaming enabled so post-prompt

        consumer degrades to send() automatically.
