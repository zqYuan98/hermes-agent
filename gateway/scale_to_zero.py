"""Scale-to-zero idle detection + dormant-quiesce for the gateway (Phase 0).

This is the gateway-side BEHAVIOUR layer that consumes the relay scale-to-zero
PRIMITIVES (gateway-gateway Phase 5: the buffered-flip, the durable per-instance
buffer, the wakeUrl poke, the reconnect supervisor). It owns the *decision* to go
idle, drives the relay transport's ``go_dormant()`` (D12), and then SUSPENDS the
machine itself through the local Fly Machines API socket. Wake stays platform-side:
autostart-on-wakeUrl (decisions.md Q3=C′).

Why the gateway self-suspends instead of relying on ``autostop:"suspend"``: Fly
Proxy judges idle exclusively on INBOUND proxied connections — it cannot see an
in-flight agent turn (outbound-only LLM traffic) and there is no way for the app
to signal "not ready to suspend". Mid-2026 the proxy also stopped treating open
OUTBOUND sockets as activity, so the relay WebSocket no longer masks the race:
Fly would suspend a machine mid-job, and could suspend BEFORE ``go_dormant()``
flipped the relay destination (the buffered-event black hole). Owning the suspend
call closes both: it only ever fires after the idle predicate (no running agents,
no live background work, inbound-quiet) holds AND the dormant quiesce completed.

Design constraints (decisions.md):
  - Per-instance enable is gated SOLELY by the NAS "Labs" toggle, carried to the
    gateway as the ``HERMES_SCALE_TO_ZERO`` env stamp (D11/Q8=A). NOT a user
    config key; ``scale_to_zero.idle_timeout_minutes`` IS config.yaml (D2).
  - Arm only when messaging is relay-only or absent (D1/F6) AND a wakeUrl is
    registered (§3.4(1)) AND the flag is set.
  - Idle = no in-flight agent turn AND no inbound for N min AND no live
    background work (D2/D3/F7).
  - The quiesce uses ``go_dormant()`` (socket closed + supervisor preserved),
    NEVER the stop/restart drain or ``disconnect()`` (F12/F14). The process stays
    alive; Fly freezes+resumes it.
  - ``mark_resume_pending`` is deliberately NOT called here (D13 — suspend
    preserves RAM; revive only if we move to autostop:"stop" or see kills).

The pure helpers (``parse_idle_timeout_seconds``, ``scale_to_zero_enabled``,
``messaging_is_relay_only_or_absent``, ``is_idle``, ``should_arm``) take plain
inputs so they unit-test without a live gateway.
