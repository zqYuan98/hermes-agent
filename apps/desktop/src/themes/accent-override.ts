/**
 * Dev-only accent override.
 *
 * Live-authoring knob for `retintTheme`: while this holds a hex, the theme
 * context paints the active skin re-seeded from it. `null` means "off" — the
 * theme paints exactly as authored, which is the only state a production build
 * can ever be in (the picker that sets this is installed under
 * `import.meta.env.DEV`).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT persisted. It's a scratch control for finding a color you
 * like, and the outcome is meant to be written into `presets.ts` as a real
 * palette — not carried around as user state that would silently override a
 * theme the user picked later.
