/**
 * Which workspace surface the window is looking at — sessions, or one exact

 * this module never parses profile names or infers connections.
 *
 * This is a SIGNAL, not a filter: consumers adapt to it — the `+` routes a new
 * session at the selected bot's profile — but nothing here decides whether a
 * pane renders. Scoping panes by workspace is how the main zone came to vanish
 * when Bot Mode's last chat closed; bot chats are ordinary tabs in the main
 * strip, beside session tabs.
 *
 * No persistence here by design: the remembered active-pane map is window-local
 * memory so a switch away and back can restore where the user was, without any
 * of it surviving the window.
