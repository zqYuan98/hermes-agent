/**
 * CHAT EMPTY STATE — the blank transcript as a contribution area.
 *
 * Core owns exactly one empty state: the intro splash, which belongs to a
 * fresh draft with no session selected. A session that exists but has nothing
 * in it yet falls outside that — and whoever opened it is the only one who
 * knows what should stand in the gap. A bot's chat wants the bot's face and
 * name; core has neither, and should not learn them.
 *
 * So the slot is contributed. A plugin claims the sessions it owns by
 * returning an element for them and `null` for everything else, which is also
 * how it stands down while the transcript is still hydrating.
 *
 * Ownership is per session, so EVERY registration is mounted and each answers
 * for itself. Declining is free; two plugins claiming one session render both,
 * which is the visible cost of never letting registration order silently
 * suppress the plugin that actually owns the chat.
