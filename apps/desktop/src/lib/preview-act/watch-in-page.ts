/**
 * WATCH OVERLAY — paints the agent's actions onto the live preview page so a
 * person can follow along: the field of things it can reach, a box round the
 * one it is about to touch, and a cursor that goes there.
 *
 * There are exactly two things on screen, and everything the agent does is said
 * with one of them:
 *
 *   - THE CURSOR — one arrow, built once, never removed. It is the
 *     collaborative-editing kind, because that is exactly what this is: a second
 *     party moving around a document you are also looking at. Arrow geometry is
 *     Liveblocks' (Apache-2.0). Plain black or white against the guest's own
 *     colour scheme rather than a brand colour: it stands for a hand, and a hand
 *     is not a feature of this app.
 *   - THE MARK — a rectangle glued to an element. A candidate, a lock, a hit
 *     and a pin are all the same object with a different row in `kinds`: how
 *     heavy the rule is, how long it lives, how it arrives. Marks are a design
 *     tool's selection blue, deliberately NOT the
 *     app's accent — this is chrome drawn on top of someone else's page, and
 *     every design tool has trained people to read that blue as "a tool has
 *     selected this", where a branded colour would read as part of the page.
 *
 * Every mark is two elements: a shell the tracker positions, and a skin that
 * carries the border and any animation. They are split because both want
 * `transform`, and a mark that animates the property the tracker rewrites every
 * frame either stops moving or stops animating.
 *
 * Injected as source (`watchInPage.toString()`) exactly like the act engine, so
 * the same rule holds: no imports, no closure references, no module-scope
 * constants — everything the body needs is declared inside it.
 *
 * Three constraints shape the implementation, each one learned from how
 * Playwright, Stagehand and browser-use solve the same problem:
 *
 *   - A page can set `z-index: 2147483647` too, and the browser's top layer
 *     (`<dialog>`, `popover`, fullscreen) outranks every z-index there is. So
 *     the host joins the top layer via `popover="manual"` instead of trying to
 *     outbid the page, and keeps the z-index only as a fallback.
 *   - A strict CSP rejects `style-src` at CSS PARSE time, which kills
 *     `cssText`, `setAttribute('style', …)` and any `<style>` we inject — but
 *     never `style.setProperty()` or `element.animate()`. So every style here
 *     is set per-property, and everything that moves is a Web Animation.
 *   - The overlay must stay out of the agent's own element inventory. It lives
 *     in a closed shadow root, which `document.querySelectorAll` does not
 *     descend into, so `collect()` cannot reach it — no exclusion list to keep
 *     in sync, and page scripts can't reach in either.
