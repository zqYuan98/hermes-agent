 * HUD mode — the chrome-free floating chat.
 *
 * A transparent, frameless, always-on-top window showing nothing but the REAL
 * composer with the reply scrolling above it, so Hermes can be driven while
 * the user works in another app (Figma, a browser).
 *
 * It is NOT a puppet window. Unlike the pet overlay / quick entry, the HUD is
 * a full app renderer with its own gateway — the same thing `openWindow()`
 * spawns, just reshaped. That is the whole design: the HUD renders `ChatView`
 * in its `hud` variant, so the composer IS the app's composer (attachments,
 * slash commands, queue, voice, model pill) rather than a lookalike that
 * drifts. This module owns only the mode flag and the window lifecycle.
