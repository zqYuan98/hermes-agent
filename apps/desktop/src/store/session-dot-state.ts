/**
 * SESSION DOT STATE — one map from session id to the single status a surface
 * should paint, so the sidebar, the pane tabs, and the switcher can never
 * disagree about what a session is doing.
 *
 * It exists for two reasons the individual membership atoms cannot cover:
 *
 * 1. PRIORITY IN ONE PLACE. The signals overlap — a session can be working AND
 *    unread AND running a background job — and resolving that per call site is
 *    how surfaces drift apart.
 * 2. LINEAGE. Compression rotates a conversation's stored id, so a sidebar row,
 *    a persisted tile, and the route can each hold a different tip of one
 *    lineage. Every state is claimed under every alias (see `lineageAliases`),
 *    so a surface gets the right answer whichever tip it happens to hold.
 *
 * The inputs are all reference-stable across stream deltas, so this recomputes
 * on status edges rather than per token.
 *
 * Unread has TWO sources, both claiming the same state: the runtime marker
 * (a turn finished in the background while this window wasn't looking at it,
 * $unreadFinishedSessionIds — transient) and the backend's derived read-state
 * watermark (row.unread — persists across restarts and is visible to every
 * surface). The write side of the persisted flag lives in session-unread.ts.
