// ── Session-scoped RPC routing (the #89206 class) ───────────────────────────
// A session-scoped RPC (session.resume / session.activate / session.usage /
// prompt.submit) only means anything on the backend that OWNS the session's
// profile. A session's profile is a PROPERTY OF THE SESSION, not of whatever
// the window is currently showing. The "active gateway" is a moving target
// (a concurrent switch, an idle-reap eviction, a failed dial, or a connection
// edit re-points it) AND, for a hidden/unlisted session, it is simply the
// WRONG backend — one that never owned the session. Dispatching there 404s or
// times out while the session's own backend is healthy (blank Bot Chats, dead
// wake-ups; local pool and SSH alike).
//
// So: a KNOWN owner is always routed to its own profile's socket — there is no
// "same as active, so use ambient" shortcut, because "active" carries no
// routing authority. Only a genuinely UNKNOWN owner (a fresh draft with no
// session yet, or truly global chrome) falls to the ambient dispatcher, and
// callers are expected to resolve the owner (cross-profile probe) before they
// reach that case for a real session.
