/** Heal a session view whose bound runtime id the gateway no longer holds.
 *
 *  The desktop learns a runtime is gone through two channels:
 *
 *  - PUSH — `session.reclaimed`. `gateway-event/lifecycle.ts` calls
 *    {@link markRuntimeGone} (same levers as the pull path) before dropping
 *    the cached state, so the primary chat resumes instead of sitting on the
 *    dead runtime until the user types.
 *  - PULL — a session-scoped RPC rejected `4001 "session not found"`. The
 *    gateway logs "client should resume the stored session" precisely because
 *    this is the terminal verdict; `_sess_nowait` has no other way to say it.
 *
 *  Every user action already honours the pull verdict: submit, slash, rewind,
 *  interrupt and the attaches run through `withSessionNotFoundResume`, which
 *  resumes the stored id and rebinds. The background pollers — the only callers
 *  that run while the user is NOT acting — did not. They either re-sent the dead
 *  id forever or (with the gone-latch) went silent against it, and in both cases
 *  the view stayed bound to a phantom runtime for the rest of its life.
 *
 *  The pull channel is the only notice when the client missed the broadcast
 *  (boot-restore, disconnect, remote gateway). Both surfaces that can hold a
 *  binding get their existing re-arm lever pulled:
 *
 *  - Tiles: `unbindTileRuntime` (SessionTilePane's resume effect refires).
 *  - The primary chat: `requestSessionResume`, the explicit-request lever. Its
 *    route-resume effect skips on `alreadyActive` — route === selected and the
 *    cached runtime === the active one — which stays true forever against a
 *    dead id, and only `explicitlyRequested` bypasses it without a reconnect.
