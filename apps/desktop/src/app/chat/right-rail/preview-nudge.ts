/**
 * OVERLAY NUDGE — the one way to say a stage to an overlay that is ALREADY on
 * the page.
 *
 * The act pipeline (preview-act.ts) injects the whole engine because it has to:
 * it needs to resolve a ref, measure a node and read the page back. The stages
 * that only narrate — the idle pulse, the read wipe — need none of that. They
 * are one function call against something the last action already left on the
 * page, so re-shipping the engine to make it would put the payload on the wire
 * on every turn boundary.
 *
 * A page the agent has never acted on has no overlay, and the nudge is a no-op
 * there. That is the right answer rather than a gap: chrome on a page the agent
 * never touched would be a lie about what it did.
