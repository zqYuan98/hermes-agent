 *   3. the session row's owner — an EXACT route when the row is
 *      connection-tagged (optimistic row from a routed create, the unified
 *      list splice, or a tag carried across a refresh), else its bare
 *      profile (the cross-profile aggregator tags rows, but a bare profile
 *      loses the connection and can lag the create);
 *   4. undefined → the caller runs the cross-profile probe, and fails closed
 *      if that misses too.
 *
 * The hint outranks the row because the row is presentation state that can
 * be stamped from the AMBIENT profile (an optimistic row minted while
 * All-profiles / Bot routing left `default` active), and because it carries
 * no connection: a fresh chat created on `local::omar` whose row read
 * `default` ran its first turn on omar and then 4001'd "session not found"
 * on the second, when the row's `default` owner won the route. The
 * connection-tagged row rung is what keeps two-turn continuity from resting
 * on the transient hint alone (bounded, evictable, gone after a relaunch).
