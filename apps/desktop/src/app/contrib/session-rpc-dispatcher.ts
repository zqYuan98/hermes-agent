/**
 * The window's ONE session-scoped RPC dispatcher, factored out of the contrib
 * wiring controller so the exact production routing (not a re-implementation)
 * can be driven by integration tests alongside the real session/prompt hooks.
 *
 * Route each RPC by the session IT targets, not by whatever tile is focused.
 * `requestGateway` is one shared closure used for every session RPC in the
 * window; keying the owner off $focusedStoredSessionId sent a NON-focused
 * tile's RPC (any bot chat while another pane is active) to the focused tile's
 * backend. That is the Bot Mode bug: a bot's prompt.submit carried its own
 * session_id but ran on the default backend (served via ?profile= from the
 * default's state.db), or 4001'd when the default backend didn't hold the
 * runtime session.
 *
 * params.session_id is a RUNTIME id, while tiles and session rows key on the
 * STORED id, so translate first (state cache, then a reverse scan of the
 * stored->runtime map, then the persisted tile map — the same ladder
 * use-session-tile-delegate uses, plus the tile rung that survives a reload
 * when the state cache is cold). A miss on ALL rungs means the id is already a
 * stored id (several RPCs pass stored ids directly), so use it as-is. Only an
 * RPC with no session_id at all (ambient/config calls) keeps the focused-tile
 * route.
 *
 * Session-scoped RPCs route to the backend that OWNS the session — never to
 * whatever is "active" (active is presentation only). The owner ladder is
 * resolveSessionRpcOwner (tile route → exact unique owner hint → the row's
 * owner: exact when connection-tagged, else its profile), then a
 * cross-profile REST probe for a hidden/unlisted session. A request with a
 * session whose owner STILL cannot be named fails closed with an explicit
 * SessionOwnerResolutionError rather than riding the ambient socket (the one
 * exception: the legacy single-backend Desktop, where ambient IS the owner).
 * Only a request with NO session at all falls to the ambient socket.
