/** The tab this bot's workspace already has open, fronted — or null when it has

 *  closed Bot Chat STAY closed: the click path used to re-open the forever-chat
 *  beside every newer thread on every bot switch, and nothing records a close
 *  (this plugin keeps no closed set; core's tile bucket only forgets), so the
 *  only honest signal is the open set itself. Feature-detected — older shells
 *  fall through to the canonical open.
 *
 *  The open set is a Local Storage cache, and it must reconcile with backend
 *  truth before it wins (hermes-agent#90102): a persisted "Bot Chat" tile can
 *  name a session the registry no longer resolves to — a superseded row from
 *  the retired pointer design, a re-minted canonical chat, a stale finished
 *  session. Fronting it re-pinned the roster click to that stale (often
 *  hidden) session forever while the row's preview described the live one.
 *  The staleness probe compares each canonical-titled tile against the
 *  roster's server-resolved `canonical_session` (identity by NAME, resolved
 *  fresh on every profiles.list): a mismatch means the registry moved on, so
 *  the tile is discarded and the click falls through to the authoritative
 *  registry open. Side-chat tabs (any other title) carry no registry identity
 *  and are never judged; an older gateway without `canonical_session` cannot
 *  judge either — both keep the tile, the pre-#90102 behavior. */
