// Deleting a cloud/remote connection used to leave every persisted group-chat
// member descriptor that referenced it behind untouched. Those orphaned rows
// (remoteSource: true, connection gone) are exactly the shape that made
// render-path route lookups throw "Bot X has no connection owner" on every
// group open, permanently — the poisoned row lives in plugin storage. The
// sweep below runs on the registry's 'removed' push (and its annotate helper
// again at hydrate for rows orphaned before this build). It never hard-deletes
// user data: the member row is kept and marked, so panes render the existing
// degraded 'Gateway removed' botSourceStatus state instead of crashing.

/** Keep the member's identity; mark it so botSourceStatus reads
 *  'Gateway removed' and no render-path route lookup can throw on it. */
