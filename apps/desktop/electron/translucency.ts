/**
 * Main-process side of window translucency.
 *
 * The mapping itself (modes, clamping, the clear-mode opacity ramp) lives in
 * apps/shared so the renderer and the main process cannot drift; this module
 * adds only what needs a BrowserWindow to mean anything.
 *
 * The import is relative rather than `@hermes/shared/translucency`: the
 * electron bundle is built by esbuild with no tsconfig path resolution (see
 * scripts/bundle-electron-main.mjs), so a bare specifier would typecheck and
 * then fail to bundle.

/**
 * BrowserWindow constructor options for a chat window's backing, given the

 *
 * Glass active → OMIT `backgroundColor` entirely. Electron reads a window as
 * translucent when it carries a vibrancy or a backdrop material, and hands a
 * translucent window a transparent default backing, so the platform material
 * shows through the page from the first frame. Passing an alpha color instead
 * does NOT work — constructor alpha needs `transparent: true`, and `#00000000`
 * on a normal window is quietly treated as opaque.
 *
 * Glass inactive → the opaque themed backing (anti-flash paint before the
 * renderer's first paint, and what clear mode fades against).
 *
 * A runtime `setBackgroundColor` swap (see applyWindowTranslucency in main)
 * only settles reliably on a window that has been compositing for a while —
 * measured on macOS 26 / Electron 40, swaps issued during roughly the first
 * seconds of a fresh process were lost, including from 'ready-to-show' and
 * 'did-finish-load' — so creation must not rely on a post-creation fixup.

/**
 * Whether a window's native opacity is worth setting at all.
 *
 * Fully opaque is what a window already is, so asking for it looks free. On
 * Windows it is the opposite of free: `setOpacity` puts `WS_EX_LAYERED` on the
 * window and calls `SetLayeredWindowAttributes(..., LWA_ALPHA)` before it even
 * looks at the value, and nothing ever takes the style back off
 * (`NativeWindowViews::SetOpacity` → `SetLayered`). A layered window
 * composites through the legacy redirection surface — which Windows documents
 * as mutually exclusive with `UpdateLayeredWindow`, and which DWM will not
 * draw a system backdrop behind. So `opacity: 1` on a glass window buys
 * nothing and costs it its acrylic.
 *
 * `current` is the way back: a window that is already faded has already paid
 * for the layering, and it has to be able to return to opaque — so it keeps
 * getting the call even when the value it is going to is 1.
 *
 * What this cannot do is un-layer. Electron offers no way back off
 * `WS_EX_LAYERED`, so a Windows window that has been faded once keeps the
 * layered compositing path until it is recreated. Not opening the door on the
 * default path is the whole of the fix; someone who deliberately fades and
 * then returns to glass still wants a restart.
