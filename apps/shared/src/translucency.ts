 *
 * - macOS vibrancy is genuinely sheer, so the tint has to come most of the way

 *   as paint. Dark takes far less: a dark field already separates, and the

 * - Windows acrylic composites its OWN tint in DWM before the page is drawn,
 *   so the renderer's tint stacks on top of a backdrop that is already doing
 *   the work. The same numbers that read as frost on a Mac read as a washed
 *   sheet here; these stay low and let DWM carry it. Fade stays at zero —
 *   `setOpacity` over a system backdrop dims the composited result rather than
 *   deepening it.
 *
 * Both sit on the frost each platform renders best: 'header' and 'titlebar'
