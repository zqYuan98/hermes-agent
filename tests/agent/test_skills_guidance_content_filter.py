"""SKILLS_GUIDANCE must not carry the phrasing Anthropic's content filter rejects.

#82154: on a subscription OAuth credential, Anthropic's server-side content
filter rejected the first sentence of the built-in ``SKILLS_GUIDANCE`` prompt
and surfaced the rejection as ``HTTP 400 "You're out of extra usage."`` —
a billing-shaped message that sent users to buy quota they did not need.

Bisected against the live API against the full 71,721-char assembled prompt:
that sentence alone reproduced the 400, and removing it alone cleared it.
Size (20 KB of filler → 200) and the ``system[0]`` identity gate (a 429, not a
400) were both ruled out.

These tests pin the reword. They deliberately assert on the *trigger substrings*
rather than on an exact replacement string, so a future rewording is free to
change the prose as long as it does not reintroduce the rejected phrasing or
drop the behaviour the sentence exists to produce.
