"""Regression: Windows gateway pause/resume must feed the #91277 Phase 2
plan-vs-execution reconciliation, not report a correctly-relaunched Windows
gateway as "unaccounted".

``_pause_windows_gateways_for_update`` / ``_resume_windows_gateways_after_update``
are Windows's own gateway restart mechanism — separate from the
systemd/launchd restart phase in ``_cmd_update_impl`` that populates
``restarted_services`` / ``relaunched_profiles`` / ``killed_pids`` /
``externally_supervised_profiles``. Before this fix, a Windows gateway that
was correctly paused and relaunched left no trace in that bookkeeping, so
``match_runtime_outcomes`` classified it "unaccounted" — the plan saw it and
NO bookkeeping mentions it — and ``report_unaccounted_runtimes`` escalated
that into ``sys.exit(1)`` even though the update (and the restart) succeeded.

``_resume_windows_gateways_after_update`` now writes the profiles it
successfully relaunched onto ``token["relaunched_profiles"]``; the update
command merges that into the shared ``relaunched_profiles`` list before
reconciliation runs (mirrored here directly, since driving the full
``_cmd_update_impl`` end to end is impractical).
