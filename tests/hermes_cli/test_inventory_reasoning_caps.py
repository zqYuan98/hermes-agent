"""Tests for the reasoning detail inventory._apply_capabilities puts on the

picker payload. The desktop model picker hides its Thinking toggle from this,
so a route that can't disable reasoning must be describable here — otherwise
the UI offers an off switch whose setting the upstream rejects.

The catalog's `supported_efforts` is intentionally absent from the payload:
the Portal honors levels a route doesn't advertise, so publishing it would
invite a picker filter that hides working levels.
