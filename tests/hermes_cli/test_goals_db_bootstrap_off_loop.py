"""SessionDB bootstrap must never run schema init on an event-loop thread.

Enterprise field report (2026-08-14): after an unclean shutdown plus a
double-instance startup race, the v25 schema migration inside
``SessionDB.__init__`` blocked the gateway's event-loop thread (reached via
``_post_turn_goal_continuation`` → ``GoalManager()`` → ``load_goal`` →
``_get_session_db``). The loop-liveness watchdog missed 3 probes and killed
the process with exit 75; the supervisor restarted into the same state —
an unbounded crash loop.

Contract fixed here, at the shared boundary (goals.py ``_get_session_db``,
which the heartbeat module reuses):

- Called on a thread with a RUNNING event loop and no cached DB, it must
  NOT construct SessionDB inline. It returns None immediately (callers
  already degrade gracefully on None) and populates the cache from a
  background thread.
- Called on a plain worker thread, it constructs inline as before.
- Once cached, every thread gets the cached instance.
