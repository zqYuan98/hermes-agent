"""_summarize_cron_failure_for_delivery must not mislabel the scheduler's own
inactivity-timeout abort as a provider/fallback-chain failure, and must not
claim a fallback chain was "exhausted" when none is configured.

Field-reported regression: a stuck `terminal`
tool call tripped the 600s cron inactivity watchdog. The TimeoutError raised
by the watchdog contains the substring "limit 600s" and its message reads
"idle for 1239s (limit 600s)" -- no provider or fallback chain was ever
involved -- but the old branch order matched the generic "timed out"/"timeout"
substring check before any inactivity-specific check existed, so the operator
saw "provider timeout. Fallback chain was exhausted or unavailable." for a
failure that had nothing to do with either.

Second bug bundled into the same fix: even on a *genuine* provider failure,
"Fallback chain was exhausted or unavailable." fired unconditionally --
regardless of whether fallback_providers was ever configured. Most installs
have fallback_providers: [], so the message always implied an
attempted-and-failed fallback that never existed. _fallback_chain_phrase() now checks the effective chain
via get_fallback_chain() and reports "No fallback chain configured." when
it's empty.
