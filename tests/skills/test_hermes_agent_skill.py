"""The `hermes-agent` skill is what a running Hermes knows about itself.

`website/` is never packaged, so an installed Hermes has no local copy of the
user guide; skills ARE synced into `$HERMES_HOME/skills/`. The skill therefore
does not try to restate the product — it routes to the published `llms.txt`,
which is generated from the docs tree on every build and so can never be behind
the feature set. These tests keep that routing honest: the index has to be where
the skill says it is, and every reference has to be reachable, otherwise a
shipped feature is invisible and the agent answers "Hermes can't do that."
