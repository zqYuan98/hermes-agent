"""Regression test for #71593 / #63311 — Telegram fallback-pool FD leak.

Background
----------
``TelegramFallbackTransport`` (plugins/platforms/telegram/telegram_network.py)
routes Telegram Bot API requests via per-IP fallback ``httpx`` pools when the
primary DNS path is unreachable.  The pre-fix version built one
``AsyncHTTPTransport`` per fallback IP eagerly in ``__init__`` and *never* tore
them down: on a retryable connect failure the handler only logged and
continued, so a socket left in ``CLOSE_WAIT`` by a peer-closed connection stayed
inside the retained pool.  Each retry leaked another file descriptor until the
gateway hit EMFILE and wedged (accept(), config reads and DNS all failing).

The fix (this PR):
  * builds fallback pools lazily via ``_get_fallback`` (nothing in ``__init__``);
  * on a retryable connect failure calls ``_reset_fallback`` which pops the
    poisoned pool out of ``self._fallbacks`` and ``aclose()``s it, so its dead
    sockets are released instead of accumulating;
  * bounds every pool at ``Limits(max_connections=8)`` as a *default* via
    ``setdefault`` — a caller-supplied ``limits`` kwarg still wins.

Contract asserted here (mutation-survivable)
---------------------------------------------
1. A retryable connect failure on a fallback IP causes that pool to be
   ``aclose()``d and dropped from ``self._fallbacks`` — NOT retained.  This is
   the discard-on-failure path: revert the ``_reset_fallback`` call in
   ``handle_async_request`` and ``test_failed_fallback_pool_is_discarded_and_closed``
   fails (the pool is retained and never closed).
2. A caller-supplied ``limits`` kwarg wins over the ``_POOL_LIMITS`` default.
