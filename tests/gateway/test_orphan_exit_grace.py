"""A retiring gateway must get long enough to finish its WAL checkpoint.

Regression for the 2026-08-31 corruption. ``gateway run --replace`` reaped the
previous instance with SIGTERM, waited **5 seconds**, then SIGKILLed any
survivor. A gateway closing a 500MB WAL store runs a PASSIVE checkpoint in
``SessionDB.close()``; on a WAL that had grown to 3936 pages (4x the 1000-page
autocheckpoint threshold) that does not reliably finish in 5s. A SIGKILL
landing mid-checkpoint leaves half-written b-tree pages — macOS ``fsync``
guarantees neither data-on-platter nor write ordering, which is exactly why
``hermes_state._enforce_macos_synchronous_full`` exists.

The port-rebinding reason the 5s deadline was introduced still holds, so the
force-kill stays — it just must not fire on a process that is still shutting
down normally, and when it does fire it must say so.
