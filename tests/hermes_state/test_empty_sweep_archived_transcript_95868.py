"""The empty-session sweep must not eat a rewound / compacted transcript (#95868).

``count_empty_sessions`` / ``delete_empty_sessions`` back the dashboard's
"Delete empty (N)" affordance. They used to define "empty" as
``sessions.message_count = 0``, which is a denormalized counter over the LIVE
(``active = 1``) rows only.

Two production transcript-rewrite paths reset that counter on purpose while
keeping every dropped turn on disk as ``active = 0``:

* ``replace_messages(..., archive_dropped=True)`` — the rewind / edit /
  regenerate mode added in #82756 precisely so a user can take a turn back
  without the rows being unrecoverable. ``prompt.submit`` reaches it with an
  empty prefix on a confirmed ordinal-0 rewind (regenerating the very first
  user turn), which is the reachable production shape.
* ``archive_and_compact`` — in-place compaction, which archives the
  pre-compaction transcript under the same session id (#38763). It normally
  publishes at least a summary row, so it lands on the same shape only when
  the live set comes back empty; pinned here as defense in depth.

Either way the row reports ``message_count = 0`` while still holding its
entire recoverable history, and those soft-archived rows are the ONLY copy —
which is the whole point of the archive-instead-of-delete guarantee that
#70516 / #80763 / #82756 were fixed to provide.

A gateway reload is what makes such a row *eligible*: every detached session
gets ``ended_at`` stamped (``end_reason='ws_orphan_reap'``), which satisfies
the sweep's ``ended_at IS NOT NULL`` gate. The next "Delete empty" click then
hard-deleted the session row AND ``DELETE FROM messages`` — silently, with no
log line to trace it by.

These tests pin the counter drift as real, and pin the sweep's refusal to act
on it.
