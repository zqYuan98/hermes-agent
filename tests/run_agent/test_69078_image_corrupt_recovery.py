"""Tests for reactive recovery when a provider rejects an image as corrupt.

Covers issue #69078: xAI returns a 400 with "...Invalid PNG image." when a
re-serialized image part in replayed history becomes undecodable. None of
the existing image-error pattern lists matched that wording, so the turn
aborted as non-retryable and the session was permanently bricked (no
further image-bearing turn could ever succeed).

The fix is deliberately narrow (see review history below): only a
recognized corruption wording routes to strip-and-retry.

  1. agent/error_classifier.py: xAI's "Invalid PNG image." wording
     classifies as FailoverReason.image_corrupt — a new reason distinct
     from image_too_large, because shrinking corrupt bytes can't fix them.
     It must NOT be routed to the shrink path, and it takes precedence
     over image_too_large when a message trips both pattern lists.
  2. agent/conversation_loop.py: the image_corrupt branch strips image
     parts via the existing _strip_images_from_messages helper and
     retries once.

An earlier revision of this fix also shipped a generic fallback — "any
non-retryable 400 with image parts present strips and retries" — without
requiring a recognized wording. Review (Sol xhigh) correctly flagged this
as too destructive: unrelated non-retryable 400s (bad tool schema,
unsupported parameter, billing, content policy) that merely happen to
carry image parts would also get their vision history silently erased and
retried, degrading sessions that were never bricked in the first place.
That branch was reverted; only the classifier-routed image_corrupt path
remains. Future provider wordings get added to _IMAGE_CORRUPT_PATTERNS
(a known-string addition) rather than reintroducing a blanket net.

No TurnRetryState guard is needed for the surviving branch: retrying only
happens when _strip_images_from_messages actually removed something, and
it removes every image_url/image/input_image part from the request in one
pass. A second image_corrupt hit on the retried (now text-only) request
finds nothing left to strip, so the branch reports no progress and falls
through to the normal error path — no separate one-shot flag required.
