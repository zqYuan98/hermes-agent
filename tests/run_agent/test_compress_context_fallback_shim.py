"""Item 1 regression — the run_agent._compress_context fallback shim must be loud.

Before the fix, _compress_context wrapped the imports of _DB_PERSISTED_MARKER
(agent.context_compressor) and _messages_match_scoped_identity
(agent.conversation_compression) in a try/except that silently defined local
fallbacks (a hard-coded ``"_db_persisted"`` literal and a local copy of the
identity helper) with NO logging. If the canonical constant/helper is renamed
or removed upstream, the import raises, the fallback silently keeps stamping
with the stale literal, and the stamping key splits from the flush's — the
duplicate-row bug this PR fixes returns with no error anywhere.

The fix imports both symbols UNCONDITIONALLY (no fallback), so a
renamed/removed symbol must fail the wrapper loudly with ImportError before
any stamping happens.

The ``already_present`` outcome is load-bearing: it keeps compress_context
from touching the deleted module-global name (which would raise NameError on
BOTH pre- and post-fix code and make the test non-discriminating), because the
stamp block at conversation_compression.py:3834-3859 — the ONLY in-module use
of _messages_match_scoped_identity — is skipped for already_present.
