"""Turn liveness watchdog (#95548): force-abort turns that stall silently.

Regression coverage for the gateway turn hang reported in #95548: a turn can
stall in the middle (observed between "model returned tool_calls" and tool
execution) with no error logged, no further progress, and the durable turn
lease kept renewing — so nothing ever force-aborts it and the session is
stuck until the gateway process is killed.

The fix adds a turn liveness watchdog next to the durable lease refresher in
``AIAgent.run_conversation`` (policy lives in ``agent/turn_liveness.py``).
It keys off the agent's activity clock (``_last_activity_ts`` — the #72039
single progress source, which lease renewal never touches). When a turn
shows no observable progress for the configured bound
(``agent.turn_liveness.timeout_s`` in config.yaml), it:

1. logs the stall loudly (surface instead of silent blocking),
2. force-interrupts the turn so it unwinds as an interrupted turn,
3. stops lease renewal so the durable lease lapses and stale-turn cleanup
   can reclaim the session even if the hard interrupt cannot unwind a
   truly wedged loop.

The abort is bound to the sampled ``(activity_generation, timestamp)`` pair
and revalidated at the commit point under the lock shared with
``_touch_activity`` (#95663 review): a turn that resumes while the stall is
being surfaced continues running and its lease keeps renewing.
