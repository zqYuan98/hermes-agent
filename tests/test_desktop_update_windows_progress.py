"""The Windows hand-off keeps serving progress while its main thread blocks.

windows.ps1 answers /progress from a dedicated runspace precisely so the
window keeps moving through the long silent stretches (`hermes update`, pip,
the desktop rebuild) that made an 18-minute update look hung. This drives the
real script and polls the real listener; the posix half of the same contract
is covered in test_desktop_update_shim_progress.py.
