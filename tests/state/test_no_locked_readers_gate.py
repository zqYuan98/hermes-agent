"""Pattern-C gate: pure-read SessionDB methods must not take the writer lock.

The gateway shares ONE SessionDB across every agent. ``self._lock`` guards
the single writer connection — any read-only query executed under it
convoys every concurrent turn's persistence behind that reader (Pattern C
of the 2026-08 perf triage; #90734 shipped the unlocked-reader subset,
this gate covers the locked-reader subset).

``_read_ctx()`` exists precisely for reads: WAL reader from a bounded
pool, no lock, with a byte-identical fallback to the locked writer when
WAL is off. Reads have no reason to hold the writer lock.

The gate parses ``hermes_state.py`` with ``ast`` and flags any method
that (a) opens ``with self._lock:`` and (b) runs ONLY read statements
(SELECT/PRAGMA-read) on ``self._conn`` inside it — i.e. a pure reader
convoying on the writer lock. Methods that write under the lock are the
lock's legitimate users and pass. New violations fail with the method
name and the fix (route through ``_read_ctx()``).

Deliberately NOT flagged:
- methods that INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/REPLACE under the lock (writers);
- read-modify-write methods (the read is ordered against its own write);
- ``_read_ctx``'s own writer-fallback (``yield self._conn`` — no execute);
- SELECTs on ``conn``/other objects (already pooled readers).
