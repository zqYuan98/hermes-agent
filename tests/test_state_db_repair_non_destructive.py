"""A failed state.db schema repair must preserve the recovery image.

For rollback-journal databases the failed-repair invariant is byte identity:
the main file and its sidecars must be unchanged.  WAL mode has an important
qualification: SQLite may checkpoint committed frames when a connection is
opened or closed, so the main file's bytes are not themselves the recovery
image.  WAL tests therefore assert committed-row and recovery semantics,
while the byte-identity assertions remain on the DELETE/rollback-journal
path.

Reported incident: the automatic repair path deleted a user's transcripts and
then reported that it had failed.

``_repair_state_db_schema_locked`` ran its strategies on the live file, and
Strategy 2 ends in ``VACUUM``::

    PRAGMA writable_schema=ON
    DELETE FROM sqlite_master WHERE name LIKE 'messages_fts%'
    PRAGMA writable_schema=OFF
    VACUUM

VACUUM does not preserve what it cannot parse — it rebuilds the file from the
schema SQLite can still read. When the damage IS in the schema b-tree (page
1's child pointers aimed at data pages, which is exactly the ``malformed
database schema ()`` class this function exists to handle), the rebuild drops
every table hanging off the unreadable part. Measured on the reporting
install: ``state.db`` went from 3048 pages / 29 sessions / 2537 messages to
113 pages, in place.

The probe that follows then correctly reported the file was *still* malformed,
so the function returned ``repaired=False`` with "manual restore from backup
may be required" — after the only live copy had already been gutted.
Destroying the data and reporting the repair failed are not mutually exclusive
outcomes, and nothing in the code treated them as a contradiction.

The pre-repair backup (#69603) is a forensic artefact, not a recovery path:
nothing reads it back. So the invariant under test is the stronger one — a
repair that does not succeed must not change the file at all — plus the
structural assertion that makes it hold: the strategies never receive the live
database.

Fix under test: every strategy runs on a ``<db>.repair-scratch`` snapshot and
is copied back through SQLite's transactional backup API only once the result
is proven to open cleanly.

Mutation-checked: pointing ``_run_repair_strategies`` back at ``db_path``
instead of the scratch copy fails
``test_failed_repair_leaves_the_original_byte_identical`` and
``test_strategies_never_receive_the_live_database``.
