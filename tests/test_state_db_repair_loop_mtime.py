"""Regression: the state.db repair-loop guards must survive an mtime change.

Incident (2026-08-17): a malformed-SCHEMA state.db sent Hermes into an
unbounded repair loop that wrote a fresh 98MB forensic copy every ~10s —
2.3GB in 20 minutes, disk heading to zero, whole agent fleet at risk.

The #86747 guards were already present and did NOT hold, because both keyed
on ``size:mtime_ns``:

* ``_db_fingerprint`` -> the ledger's attempt counter reset to 1 on every
  pass, so ``_MAX_PERSISTENT_REPAIR_ATTEMPTS`` was never reached;
* ``_backup_db_file``'s dedupe compared mtime, so it never matched and each
  pass wrote another full-size copy.

Unlike the b-tree damage of #86747, the malformed-SCHEMA class still opens
and accepts writes (only ``sqlite_master`` is unreadable), so live writers,
WAL checkpoints and the in-place repair strategies all move mtime between
passes. These tests pin the guards to content, not mtime, and add the
missing free-space refusal.
