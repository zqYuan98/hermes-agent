"""Regression test for #86632: cron's synchronous delegate_task fallback must
return after the child completes — the automatic background review must not
fire inside the delegated child.

Field signature (issue #86632): a cron job's top-level ``delegate_task`` takes
the #66617 stateless-channel synchronous fallback, the child finishes its turn
normally (``Turn ended: reason=text_response``), and the delegation never
returns to the parent — the heartbeat monitor goes stale and the cron
inactivity watchdog kills the job.  Root cause (traced in the issue thread and
fixed by the ``_delegate_depth`` guard in ``AIAgent._spawn_background_review``):
the child's turn finalization spawned the automatic memory/skill background
review fork.  Delegated children must never spawn that fork — it inherits the
child's (often premium) model, replays the whole conversation, and its spawn
inside the child's finalize path is the wedge site the cron watchdog kills.

This exercises the REAL end-to-end #86632 path: a genuine ``AIAgent`` child
(mocked LLM client) with the skill-review trigger armed, dispatched through
``delegate_task(background=True)`` under a session runtime where async delivery
is unsupported (cron), forcing the synchronous fallback.
