"""Leave a mark on the page in the Hermes desktop GUI's in-app browser.

``drive_preview`` already draws every move it makes — the field it can reach,
a box round its target, the cursor going there — but those are transients:
each one stands for a single action and retires itself. That is right for
narrating a click and no use at all for holding a finding on screen.

This is the deliberate one. An annotation outlines an element — or, with
``hold``, the entire visible field at once — and stays until the agent takes it
down, so it can show the user what it found, flag the fields
it is about to fill, or keep its place while it works elsewhere on the page.
Named for TouchDesigner's Annotate — the labelled box you drop around part of a
network to call it out.

Annotations are bound to elements, not coordinates: they ride scrolls and
reflows, and they go when their element does, so a navigation clears them
without the agent having to.

Rides the same ``preview.act`` bridge as ``drive_preview`` rather than opening
a second channel — the renderer already resolves ``@e`` refs and owns the
overlay, so this is one more verb on a wire that exists.

Lives in the ``desktop_ui`` toolset, which the GUI gateway enables only for
desktop-sourced sessions.
