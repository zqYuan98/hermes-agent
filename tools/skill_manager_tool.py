"""
Skill Manager Tool -- Agent-Managed Skill Creation & Editing

Allows the agent to create, update, and delete skills, turning successful
approaches into reusable procedural knowledge. New skills are created in
~/.hermes/skills/. Existing skills (bundled, hub-installed, or user-created)
can be modified or deleted wherever they live.

Skills are the agent's procedural memory: they capture *how to do a specific
type of task* based on proven experience. General memory (MEMORY.md, USER.md) is
broad and declarative. Skills are narrow and actionable.

Actions:
  create     -- Create a new skill (SKILL.md + directory structure)
  edit       -- Replace the SKILL.md content of a user skill (full rewrite)
  patch      -- Targeted find-and-replace within SKILL.md or any supporting file
  delete     -- Remove a user skill entirely
  write_file -- Add/overwrite a supporting file (reference, template, script, asset)
  remove_file-- Remove a supporting file from a user skill

Directory layout for user skills:
    ~/.hermes/skills/
    ├── my-skill/

    a *verified consolidation*: the skill's content was absorbed into an
    umbrella, declared via ``absorbed_into=<umbrella>`` where the umbrella
    exists on disk (validated separately in ``_delete_skill``).

    A delete with no forwarding target — ``absorbed_into`` omitted (``None``)
    or empty (``""``) — is the fail-open behavior reported in #29912: the
    consolidation pass archived whole clusters of active skills with zero
    verified consolidations (``consolidated_this_run == 0``), leaving active
    automations pointing at names that no longer resolve. The deterministic
    inactivity prune is the only legitimate prune path, and it archives via
    ``skill_usage.archive_skill()`` directly without ever calling
    ``skill_manage`` — so a bare prune reaching here can only be the LLM pass
    pruning without consolidation evidence. Refuse it; keep the skill active.

    Returns an error dict to abort the delete, or ``None`` when the delete is
    allowed to proceed (not the curator pass, or a declared consolidation).
