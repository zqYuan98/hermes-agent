"""Read the in-app browser / preview pane in the Hermes desktop GUI.

The preview's content lives in the desktop renderer (a sandboxed ``<webview>``
for URL tabs), so this tool round-trips through the gateway's blocking-prompt
bridge — the same one ``read_terminal`` uses: tui_gateway emits
``preview.read.request``, the renderer serializes the active preview tab and
answers with ``preview.read.respond``. This module is just schema + a thin
dispatcher over the platform-injected callback.

Lives in the ``desktop_ui`` toolset, which the GUI gateway enables only for
desktop-sourced sessions.
