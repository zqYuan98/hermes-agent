"""Point at something in the Hermes desktop GUI and say one line about it.

The quiet sibling of ``tour``. Same durable ``data-tour`` handles, same
discovery call (``tour(action="targets")``) — but no scrim, no spotlight, and no
Next/Prev. Just an accent-lit bubble with an arrow into whatever the tip is
about, which is the right weight for "that button, there" in the middle of a
sentence.

Fire-and-forget, unlike ``tour``: a tip is not a question, so blocking the turn
on a round-trip would stall the reply it belongs to.

Lives in the ``desktop_ui`` toolset, which the GUI gateway enables only for
desktop-sourced sessions, and withdraws itself entirely when the user has
turned tips off (Settings → Appearance). Off means the model is never told the
tool exists — a switch that only made the call fail would leave Hermes
promising to point at things it cannot point at.
