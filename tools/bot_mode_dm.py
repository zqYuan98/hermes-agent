"""Bot Mode agent-to-agent DM tool — ``message_agent``.

A structured, Bot-Chat-only tool that lets a Bot Mode agent message a
teammate agent (another Hermes profile on this install, or an agent on a
registered peer gateway) WITHOUT hand-assembling shell commands.

Why this exists (Aug 2026): the Bot Mode teammate protocol taught agents to
DM each other via a prompt-injected ``hermes -p <bot> chat ...`` shellout.
That transport works, but the *invocation* was fragile — quoting traps
(#91339/#91304), temp-file choreography, dead-profile races — and the
Desktop's remote-mention path forwarded raw user text verbatim (#91397).
``message_agent`` replaces the invocation with a real tool call: the message
is a parameter, the target is validated against the live roster, the
attribution prefix is applied server-side, and the reply arrives through the
existing background-process notification path (fire-and-forget, never
blocks the sender's turn).

Containment contract (MUST hold — reviewers check all three):
- The tool schema is injected ONLY into a bot's canonical "Bot Chat"
  session on Bot-Mode-managed installs — the exact same gate as the
  protocol section in ``tools/bot_mode_probe.py``. It is NOT registered in
  the global tool registry, is NOT part of any toolset, and never appears
  in CLI sessions, ordinary gateway chats, group-room member sessions
  (titled "Group: …"), cron agents, or subagents.
- Dispatch is title-gated again at execution time (defense in depth): a
  forged call from a session that shouldn't have the tool returns a
  structured error instead of delivering.
- Everything here is additive. The legacy protocol transports
  (``hermes -p`` / ``hermes peer dm``) keep working for older prompts.

The transports themselves are unchanged and proven:
- local teammate  → ``hermes -p <name> chat --in ~ -c "Bot Chat"
  --create-if-missing -Q --query-file <tmp>`` (one turn, reply on stdout)
- peer teammate   → ``hermes peer dm <peer>[/<name>] < <tmp>``

Both run through ``terminal_tool(background=True, notify_on_complete=True)``
so the reply lands as a completion notification on the sender's NEXT turn —
the same wake shape every Bot Mode agent already knows.
