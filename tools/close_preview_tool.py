"""Close the Hermes desktop GUI's preview pane, or one of its tabs.

Lives in the ``desktop_ui`` toolset (same as ``open_preview``), which the GUI
gateway enables only for a session whose source is the desktop app. Emits
``preview.close`` through the shared ``desktop_ui`` bridge; the renderer drops
the matching tab — or the whole pane when no url is given — for the window
that asked and never steals a background session's view.
