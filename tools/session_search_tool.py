Session Search Tool - Long-Term Conversation Recall

Single-shape tool with four calling modes (inferred from args, no explicit
mode parameter):

  1. DISCOVERY — pass ``query``. Runs FTS5 and dedupes hits by session lineage.
     Adaptive detail (the default) fully hydrates the top result with a ±5
     message window and bookends, while lower-ranked results keep the exact
     anchor message plus metadata. Pass ``detail="full"`` to fully hydrate
     every result. Zero LLM cost.

  2. SCROLL — pass ``session_id`` + ``around_message_id``. Returns a window
     of ±window messages centered on the anchor, no FTS5, no bookends. To
     scroll forward / backward, re-anchor on the last / first message id of
     the returned window.

  3. READ — pass ``session_id`` without an anchor. Returns the whole session,
     or a bounded head/tail view for large sessions.

  4. BROWSE — no args. Returns recent sessions chronologically (titles,
     previews, timestamps).

All four modes operate on the SQLite session DB via the FTS5 index and
the get_anchored_view / get_messages_around primitives in hermes_state.
No LLM calls anywhere — every shape returns actual messages from the DB.

History: PR #20238 (JabberELF) seeded a fast/summary dual-mode split; the
toolkit expansion in PR #26419 (yoniebans) added the anchored drill-down,
bookends, and sort. This module merges all of that into a single calling
shape with no mode parameter, no summary LLM path, and explicit scroll
support.
