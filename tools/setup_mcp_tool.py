"""Propose an MCP server to the user as an inline card in the desktop chat.

The card (install / enable / authorize + decline) lives in the desktop
renderer, so this tool round-trips through the gateway's blocking-prompt
bridge — the same one ``clarify`` uses: tui_gateway emits
``mcp.setup.request``, the renderer walks the user through the flow via the
existing REST endpoints (catalog install, enable, OAuth), and answers with
``mcp.setup.respond`` once the flow settles. This module is just schema + a
thin dispatcher over the platform-injected callback.

Lives in the ``desktop_ui`` toolset, which the GUI gateway enables only for
desktop-sourced sessions — on every other surface the agent falls back to
``hermes mcp install <name>`` in the terminal.
